title: "Debugging"
---

Use Bezi's in-depth project (scripts, assets, scenes, packages, etc.) and Unity knowledge to find, interpret, and fix bugs faster than manual or code-only investigation.

The more information about a bug that you give Bezi, the faster it will find and fix the issue. Pin important information and attach images to your prompt as much as possible!

<Danger>
  Never submit vague prompts like "_fix errors_" or "_not working_". Bezi won't know what you're talking about, nothing will get fixed, and you'll waste a valuable prompt!
</Danger>

## What types of bugs can Bezi help with?

1. Console errors
2. Behavioral issues
3. Optimization

## Steps to fix console errors

1. **Tell Bezi to implement a fix for a console error**
2. Attach a screenshot of the console error code or copy/paste it in the prompt field
3. [[**Agent Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/fundamentals/ask-mode)] Submit one prompt with all the information in Steps 1-2
4. Test the fix and iterate as needed with Bezi

## Steps to fix behavioral and optimization issues

_These issues aren't standardized like console errors and require a bit more information to fix_

1. **Tell Bezi you want an explanation and possible solutions for a bug**
2. Explain the current state of whatever is operating incorrectly
3. Define the expected or ideal state
4. Take screenshots of the bug (required for all visual issues)
5. Identify important inputs and information (assets, pages, scripts, etc.)
6. [[**Ask Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/fundamentals/ask-mode)] Draft a prompt with all the information in Steps 1-5,
   1. add the inputs from Step 5 as [**in-line pins**](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pins) (type `@`, then the name to pin)
   2. [**attach images**](https://docs.bezi.com/context/image-attachments) from Step 4 to the prompt
1. Submit the prompt
2. Iterate with Bezi until you’re happy with the proposed solution
1. [[**Agent Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/fundamentals/ask-mode)] Tell Bezi to implement the fix you liked
2. Test the fix and iterate as needed with Bezi

## What do I do if Bezi's fix doesn't work?

If Bezi isn't able to fix it on the first try, it's likely missing a key piece of information.

**DO**: Review the information you've given Bezi, try to figure out what context it's missing and [edit the last prompt](https://docs.bezi.com/more/edit-prompts) to include that information.

**DO NOT**: Prompt "_still broken_", "_not working_", or anything vague like that. It won't help and risks sending Bezi down a rabbit hole!
