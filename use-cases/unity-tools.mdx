description: "Generate fully-functional tools, purpose built for a task or your workflow."

When you can generate tools in minutes instead of building them manually**or distracting teammates** , you're free to use them for all sorts of manual and repetitive tasks—**from small one-offs to huge, once-painful processes** .

## How can I use Bezi to automatically create tools?

1. Define what you want the tool to do
2. Prompt Bezi with the right details (Steps 1-5, [**below**](https://docs.bezi.com/use-cases/unity-tools#steps-to-create-a-custom-tool)) and tell it to create a tool
3. Bezi will generate a tool to meet your exact purpose and specs!

<Tip>
  If you have guidelines or standards that Bezi-generated tools should follow, document them in a [**Page**](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pages) and [pin the page](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pins) whenever you ask Bezi to create a tool.

## Steps to create a custom tool

The instruction and detail in your prompt dictates the tool's level of completion and polish...

1. **Tell Bezi you want it to create a Unity tool**
2. Define the process or workflow you want to automate
3. Define what the tool’s output should be, in as much detail as possible
4. Define any tool structure requirements: the form it should take, UI preferences, etc.
5. Identify important inputs and project information for the tool (assets, pages, scripts, etc.)
6. [[**Agent Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode)] Draft a prompt with all the information in Steps 1-5, add the inputs from Step 5 as [in-line pins](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pins) (type `@`, then the name to pin)
7. Submit the prompt
8. Bezi creates the tool in Unity and writes documentation on how to use it
   - Bezi creates all tool scripts in Unity
   - If tool set-up requires attaching scripts in-scene, Bezi will give instructions for this step
1. Start using your tool!

## Steps to edit a Bezi-created tool

**If you generally like the tool but want to make a few minor edits...**

1. [**Agent Mode**] Write another prompt with a detailed explanation of the edits
   - Include current state vs desired state
   - [Attach images](https://docs.bezi.com/context/image-attachments) for any visual edits
2. Submit the prompt and test the updated tool
3. Select Keep All on the response if you like it. If not, edit the last prompt to include missing details or specifications that Bezi needes

**If you want something very different than what was created...**

1. Click the edit button on the original prompt
2. Accept the pop-up to revert changes (this undoes any changes made after the edited prompt)
3. Identify what information is missing or needs editing in the original tool prompt to get what you want
4. Edit the prompt to account for that missing/incorrect info and submit!

## Prompt examples

1. Automate a repetitive process/pipeline
   - **Prompt Example**: _`Make a setup tool that will configure a given animal FBX as a prefab with the necessary components (@AnimalController.cs, Rigidbody, Collider). In the tool UI, include a dropdown for all animal types in @Animals folder, and add the selected animal-type’s script. Follow the rules in @UI-Guidelines-Page`_.
2. Automate UI create
   - **Prompt Example**: _`Make a tool that will create the pictured UI for the Achievements screen. Create it as a prefab, use TextMeshPro, and include the ability to assign each sprite. Follow the scaling guidelines in @UI-Guidelines-Page`_.
3. Automate very manual, 1-off setup process
   - **Prompt Example**: _Create a partial ragdoll generator tool that I can attach to an object to setup configurable joints on it and all of its children_.
4. Create a more intuitive interface for a visual/artistic workflow
   - **Prompt Example**: _Create a canvas tool to help me lay out and generate new levels. I want to be able to add tiles, with each tile corresponding to a different prefab; place them on the grid; and press a button that generates that layout in-scene_.
