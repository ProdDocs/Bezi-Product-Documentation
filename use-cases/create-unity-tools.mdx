title: "Create Unity Tools"
---

It’s very easy to generate a fully-functional tool, purpose built for a task or workflow, using Bezi. 

When tools creation is automated and highly customized to a niche task or workflow, you can use them more freely. Take advantage of having a custom tool generater on-hand! 

## How can I use Bezi to automatically create Unity Tools?

1. Document what you want the tool to do
2. Prompt Bezi with the right details (Steps 1-5, **below**) and ask it to create a tool
3. Bezi will create a tool for your exact specs!

<Tip>
  If you have guidelines or standards that Bezi-generated tools should follow, document them in a [**Page**](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pages) and [pin the page](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pins) whenever you ask Bezi to create a tool.

## Steps to create a Unity Tool 

The level of instruction and detail in the tool prompt dictates the tool's detail and polish.

1. **Tell Bezi you want it to create a Unity tool**
2. Define the process or workflow you want to automate
3. Define what the tool’s output should be, in as much detail as possible
4. Define any tool structure requirements: the form it should take, UI preferences, etc.
5. Identify important inputs  from the project (these will be in-line prompt pins)
6. [[**Agent Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode)] Draft a prompt with all the information in Steps 1-5. Add [**in-prompt pins**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/prompt-tagging) for all inputs and variables from Step 5 (type `@`, then the name)
7. Submit the prompt
8. Bezi creates the tool in Unity and writes documentation on how to use it
   1. Bezi create all tool scripts in Unity but, if tool set-up requires attaching scripts in-scene, Bezi will give instructions to complete this step
9. Use your tool! 

### Steps to edit a Unity Tool created by Bezi

**If you like the Unity Tool but have a few minor edits:**

1. [Agent Mode] Write another prompt with a detailed explanation of the edits
2. Submit the prompt and test the updated tool
3. Select Keep All on the response if you like it. If not, keep tweaking

**If you want something very different than what was created:**

1. Click the edit button on the original prompt
2. Accept the pop-up to revert changes (this undoes any changes made after the edited prompt)
3. Identify what information is missing or needs editing in the original tool prompt to get what you want
4. Edit the prompt to account for that missing/incorrect info and submit!

## Prompt examples

1. Automate a repetitive process/pipeline
   - **Prompt Example**: _Make a setup tool that will configure a given animal FBX as a prefab with the necessary components (@AnimalController.cs, Rigidbody, Collider). In the tool UI, include a dropdown for all animal types in @Animals folder, and add the selected animal-type’s script. Follow the rules in @UI-Guidelines-Page._
2. Automate UI create
   - **Prompt Example**: _Make a tool that will create the pictured UI for the Achievements screen. Create it as a prefab, use TextMeshPro, and include the ability to assign each sprite. Follow the scaling guidelines in @UI-Guidelines-Page._
3. Automate very manual, 1-off setup process
   - **Prompt Example**: _Create a partial ragdoll generator tool that I can attach to an object to setup configurable joints on it and all of its children._
4. Create a more intuitive interface for a visual/artistic workflow
   - **Prompt Example**: _Create a canvas tool to help me lay out and generate new levels. I want to be able to add tiles, with each tile corresponding to a different prefab; place them on the grid; and press a button that generates that layout in-scene._
