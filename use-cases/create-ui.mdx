title: "Create UI"

Bezi creates UI by generating custom tools that spawn gameObjects and other UI setup related materials in-scene. This ensures speed AND accuracy.

<Note>
  _Bezi has not been trained to create visually perfect hierarchy canvas, visual assets, or polish at this time._
</Note>

The more detail and specificity in a prompt, the better Bezi’s output will be. With the right prompting, you can reach relatively complete and polished UI, depending on the task

- **Layout & Functionality:** 90% completion via the tool. The remaining 10% depends on manual customizations or polish.
- **Visual Assets & Polish**: Bezi can't generate this for you, directly _or_ through a tool. It <u>CAN</u> make it easier to configure them (e.g. to swap out sprites, fonts, text, etc.) but the polish is in your hands.

## How can I use Bezi to automatically create UI?

1. Define what you want
2. Create a [Page](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pages) documenting all UI Standards (e.g. prefab structures, sprite/text inputs, etc.)
3. Prompt Bezi with all the right details (Steps 1-5, **below**) and tell it to create a tool to implement the UI to spec
4. Bezi will generate a tool and provide instructions for how to use it

## Precursors for using Bezi to create UI

**Any UI-related work needs a **[**Page**](https://docs.bezi.com/context/pages)** where the standards and guidelines are defined**. Pin the UI Page(s) whenever you're doing relevant work to ensure Bezi has all the information it needs. 

### What to include in a UI Page

1. UI specs / parameters
2. Template (if you have one)
3. Dev best practices to follow for UI setup, prefabs, organization, exposed inputs, etc.
4. List any UI requirements that must be met

### UI Page Examples; copy into your Bezi page and customize!

    **Code Rules:**

    - ALWAYS use a coroutine when creating hierarchies
    - ALWAYS add a "yield return null" after adding a component, obtain a reference to that component after the yield statement
    - ALWAYS use textmeshproUGUI not Text
    - ALWAYS use a callback to return new gameObjects created in coroutines
    - ALWAYS create a prefab for groups of objects that are repeated, Add them to the "Prefab/GeneratedUI" folder
    - ALWAYS use prefabs for objects that can be considered to be a separated section of the UI
    - ALWAYS re-use a created prefab for repeated objects
    - ALWAYS separate the creation of a prefab from the UI creation, create the prefab first and re-use it
    - NEVER add readme code
    - NEVER add code to implement the feature just the code to create the UI
    - If a for, foreach or while loop is used create a prefab
    - ONLY use layout groups when the number of child objects is likely to change
    - Use the slider component for progress bars

    **Tool Rules:**

    - ALWAYS provide a window for the asset hierarchy creation process
    - Make this window available from a menu item inside Tools\>UIBuilder\>{Name}
    - Include the ability to assign font assets where appropriate
    - Include the ability to assign sprite assets where appropriate
    - Ignore UI elements that could be considered decorations

    **General Rules:**

    - Search the current scene for a canvas object to place the new UI
    - Ensure that you use Unity.EditorCoroutineUtility
