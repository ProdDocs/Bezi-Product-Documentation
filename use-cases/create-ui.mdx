Bezi creates UI by generating custom tools that spawn gameObjects and other UI setup related materials in-scene. This ensures speed AND accuracy.

_Please note: Bezi has not been trained to create visually perfect hierarchy canvas, visual assets, or polish at this time._

## How can I use Bezi to automatically create tools?
