### Explain the game 

Start every project by giving Bezi context on what you’re trying to create. This also lets Bezi help steer you in the right direction if things get off course\!

### Specifics make a huge difference\! 

The clearer your prompt, the better the results. Including details like what buttons you want an action mapped to, scripts you want to update, and components you want to use make for results that are far more likely to meet your needs.

### Pin important or relevant information before you prompt

Pinning allows you to get specific without writing long, asset-packed prompts. Select the objects in Unity and click the `pin` icon next to them in Bezi's prompt bar to make sure they’re factored into the answer.

### Include negatives

It's helpful for Bezi to know what you _don’t_ want to prevent noisy behavior and hallucinations. Bezi may _think_ it understands what your prompt means, but has misinterpreted it and is heading in the wrong direction. Negatives are also helpful for behavioral debugging\!

### Provide references

Bezi is well-versed in popular mechanics and games. Directly referencing any works you want Bezi to take inspiration from is a great way to communicate specifics while keeping the prompt brief.
