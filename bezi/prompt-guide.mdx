## Things to do

### Identify the goal and describe results

Two ways to interpret this: first, on the prompt-to-prompt scale. Try to word your questions in terms of the endpoint you want to reach.

Second, on the project-wide scale, start new tasks with a description of your project’s ultimate goal. Providing Bezi with a description of your game idea lets it make suggestions with that in mind, and can help it better understand future asks

> **Pro tip**: Create rules documents. We have feature for this in-progress, but for now you can describe your idea and requirements in a .TXT file, then save it in your Unity project and pin it to your prompt. This ensures that the contents are always factored in.

### Specify a role/persona

State the perspective and the level of expertise you want from Bezi. For example, “_Act as an expert_” vs. “_Explain X to a student_”, or “_I’m a level designer, trying do Y_.”

### Be specific

Add as much relevant information as you can/have. Think about **what keys to map to**, **what object you’ll attach them to**, **desired console**, **relevant tags**, etc. The clearer you are, the more likely it is that the result will match the idea.

### Reference assets and links

Bezi does its best to gather the right info, but if you know something is essential, the only way to be 100% sure it’s accounted for is to require it with tagging. Use **@** to search Unity from within Bezi, or select important stuff while you're in Unity and click the pill(s) that appear above Bezi's input field.

### Edit and iterate

Simple informational asks can be combined into one prompt, but for asks that need larger outputs from Bezi, break down your idea into multiple prompts and build it up from the foundation to get the best results.

If a response doesn’t touch on what you need, **edit** the original message to set yourself back on the right path. If that still goes off track, the best way to get reset is to **start a new task** and iterate from there.

## Things to avoid

### Fluff and anti-prompts

Don’t be overly wordy or polite, and don’t use words you wouldn’t want to see in Bezi's response. If you **need** to instruct Bezi to ignore something, use strong language like “**_never_**”.

Clear, organized prompts lead to better responses, so keep asks readable and concise.

### Overpacked prompts

Too many processing steps can lead to disorganized, cluttered responses. For (a bad) example: “_first search for A, then search for B, then write C, then combine A and B, then finally make D_.”

Keep prompts task-specific and, if you need to pivot, do so with a new prompt or task.

### Repetition

Don’t prompt the same question multiple times. Results are dependent on gathered context, so if you’re not getting the response that you need from a prompt, repeating it is unlikely to get you a better result. Instead, **edit** the prompt to add more context or information or start a new task with the rephrased prompt for a clean slate.

### Old or irrelevant tags for new prompts

Bezi won’t untag assets when you start a new prompt, so check tags before posting a new prompt to be sure irrelevant info isn't accidentally included. The context prioritizes what you tag, so unrelated assets can take a task down the wrong path.
