## Usage-based overages

If you're on a paid plan and reached your subscription credit limit, you can buy extra credits to continue your work in Bezi. 

1. Open your subscription settings page:  https://app.bezi.com/account
2. Toggle on **Enable usage-based pricing **
3. Set your monthly spending limit and select `Save`
4. Return to Bezi to continue your work\! 

These overage costs will be charged to the card on file for the paid subscription. Overage costs are charged at regular intervals, not at the end of a month. 

If any overage payments fail, you'll be unable to continue prompting until the payment succeeds. 

## How usage is measured

Bezi uses “credits” to measure usage. 1 credit = 1 **completed** prompt. A completed prompt means you submit a prompt and receive a response from Bezi. This includes existing prompts that you edit, as Bezi will return a new response.

For example, if you submit a prompt and Bezi gets stuck in “thinking mode” or isn’t able to respond to your prompt for any reason, that prompt will not count towards usage.

## How to monitor credit usage

Navigate to **Your Subscription** to see which Bezi plan you’re on, how many credits are included in that plan, and credits remaining for the current billing cycle.

1. Open the Bezi app
2. Click on the `Account` icon in the upper right corner
3. Select `Your Subscription` in the left-hand sidebar
