## **How usage is measured**

Bezi uses “credits” to measure usage. 1 credit = 1 **completed** prompt. A completed prompt means you submit a prompt and receive a response from Bezi.

If you submit a prompt and Bezi gets stuck in “thinking mode” or isn’t able to respond to your prompt for any reason, that prompt will not count towards usage.
