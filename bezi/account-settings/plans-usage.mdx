## How usage is measured

Bezi uses “credits” to measure usage. 1 credit = 1 **completed** prompt. A completed prompt means you submit a prompt and receive a response from Bezi. This includes existing prompts that you edit, as Bezi will return a new response.

For example, if you submit a prompt and Bezi gets stuck in “thinking mode” or isn’t able to respond to your prompt for any reason, that prompt will not count towards usage.

## How to monitor credit usage 

From the **Your Plan** section, you can see which Bezi plan you’re on, how many credits are included in the plan, and your remaining credits for the current billing cycle.

1. Open the Bezi app
2. Click on the `Account` icon in the upper right corner
3. Select `Your Plan` in the left-hand sidebar
