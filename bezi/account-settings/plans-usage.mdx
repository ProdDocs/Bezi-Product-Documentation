## Available plans

See [bezi.com/pricing](https://www.bezi.com/pricing) for Bezi Plan options and information.

Custom plans are available for custom model selection, advanced security or SSO, custom credit limits, admin dashboards, and centralized billing. Email [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com) to learn more. 

## How usage is measured

Bezi uses “credits” to measure usage. 1 credit = 1 **completed** prompt. A completed prompt means you submit a prompt and receive a response from Bezi. This includes existing prompts that you edit, as Bezi will return a new response.

For example, if you submit a prompt and Bezi gets stuck in “thinking mode” or isn’t able to respond to your prompt for any reason, that prompt will not count towards usage.

## How to monitor credit usage

Navigate to **Your Subscription** to see which Bezi plan you’re on, how many credits are included in that plan, and % of credits remaining for the current billing cycle.

1. Open the Bezi app
2. Click on the `Account` icon in the upper right corner
3. Select `Your Subscription` in the left-hand sidebar
