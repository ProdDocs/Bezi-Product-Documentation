## How do I access my Bezi subscription and billing settings?

The Subscription Settings page is where you can manage all aspects of your subscription and billing. You will need to login in order to access it.

<Note>
  Access your subscription settings page at: https://app.bezi.com/account
</Note>

## How do I start a subscription for the first time?

To continue using Bezi after your trial, open [Subscription Settings](https://app.bezi.com/account) and select a plan. This will open your secure Stripe billing portal (webpage) where you will:

1. Select whether you want to be billed monthly or yearly (20% discount)
2. Select payment method
3. Add payment details
4. Click `Subscribe`

Your billing cycle will start the day you subscribe. The payment method added will be saved by Stripe and automatically charged on future renewal dates, unless changed by you.

## How do I update my subscription or billing information?

If you’re subscribed to a paid Bezi plan (not the free trial) you can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel the subscription. Any changes to an existing subscription will take place from your Subscription Settings: https://app.bezi.com/account

  <Accordion title="Upgrade">
    Upgrades **go into effect immediately**. Your existing subscription will be cancelled and replaced with the new subscription
