### Bezi **didn't respond with what I wanted. How do I get the right responses?**&#x20;

If the original prompt had multiple questions or actions in it, break each request into a separate prompt.&#x20;

Prompts with very specific instructions are more likely to succeed. Give Bezi as much detail as you can, such as; define the requirements, name the object you want it to focus on, explain the desired outcome.

### **I gave** Bezi **a prompt and now it's stuck in "thinking mode".**

If the connection indicators in Unity and Bezi are both green, but Bezi is stuck in "thinking mode" there are a few ways to reset it:

1. Right-click anywhere in the Bezi app and select `Reload`

2. Quit and reopen Bezi

3. Quit and reopen Unity

### **How do I know if  Unity and** Bezi **aren't connected?**

You'll be able to identify a lost connection by checking the connection indicators in Unity and Bezi. If either are red, the apps cannot communicate.&#x20;

### **How do I reinstate a lost connection between Unity and** Bez&#x69;**?**

There are a few common reasons and fixes:&#x20;

1. Check that you have reliable internet connection

2. Confirm both the Unity project and the Bezi app are open

3. If the connection indicator bar in Unity is red, click on it to retry the connection

4. Check which version of Unity you're on. Bezi supports the following:

   * Best: **Unity 2022 LTS** (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)

   * Supported: **2021 LTS**

   * Supported with risk: **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1** (in active development by Unity, which can impact external apps)

### **What do Asset Sync errors mean?**&#x20;

Asset Sync errors can mean a number of different things, such as: Bezi wasn't able to access all the assets in the Unity project or the sync cut-out part way through. If you open Asset Sync there is more information on which assets failed to sync and why.&#x20;

### **How do I resolve Asset Sync errors?**

1. Do not sync while play mode is open in Unity

2. Open the Bezi Asset Sync dialog and select the **sync** icon

### **I opened** Bezi **and got stuck on the splash screen. How do I get past it?**&#x20;

This happens when the app is out of date and the auto-update wasn't able to execute. Follow these steps to manually update the app:

1. Open [https://bezi.com/auth-app](https://bezi.com/auth-app)

2. Select the `Launch app` button

3. Follow the prompts to update the app to the newest version

If that doesn’t work, go to the the [Get Sidekick](https://bezi.com/start?source=sidekick) page and manually download the latest version of the Bezi app.&#x20;
