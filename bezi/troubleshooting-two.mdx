## How to report a bug or issue

If you run into something that seems like a bug and/or isn’t covered in this page, please let us know so we can help resolve it. To do so, either:

1. Email [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com)
2. Post in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9)

## **App Setup and Connecting Bezi to Your Unity Project**

### **What versions of Unity does Bezi support?**

- Best: **Unity 2022 LTS** (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)
- Supported: **2021 LTS**
- Supported: **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1** (in active development by Unity, which can impact it's ability to support external apps and Bezi’s ability to have the most recent information on terminology changes, etc.)

### **I got a popup that said “_Failed to install Unity Plugin_” in the Bezi app when I tried connecting it with my Unity project. What do I do?**

Occasionally this error shows if a Unity set-up isn’t conducive with the Bezi plugin. Please try these things (in order) to see if either resolve. If neither work, reach out to [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com) for assistance.

1. Confirm that the Unity project you’re trying to connect is in a folder with write permissions
2. Download Unity 2022 LTS and run Bezi as administrator

### **Why am I seeing a '_Consent Request_' pop-up?**

The pop-up is completely safe to accept, and will only modify the scripts that make Bezi; none of your personal files should be affected.

We use some APIs that can be auto-updated by Unity, but these may change between versions. The app was created with Unity 2022 LTS, and any APIs involved date back to that version. This pop-up just updates them to use the latest for whatever version of Unity you’re working in.

### **How do I know if Bezi is connected to my Unity project?**

The connection indicators in your Unity project and Bezi app will both be green if they’re connected. If either are red, the connection is broken and the apps cannot communicate.

If you've installed the plugin but Bezi and Unity aren't successfully connecting, see the question below about troubleshooting a failed or lost connection.

### **How do I manually update the Bezi plugin in Unity?**

When a new version of Bezi is released, a green button directing you to update your app and plugin will appear. Click the button to update the Bezi app and the Unity plugin before you start or resume working. 

Occasionally Unity’s Package Manager doesn’t automatically update the plugin. If you recently updated Bezi and it doesn’t seem to work with Unity, follow these steps:

1. Close Bezi: right-click on the desktop app \> `Quit`
2. Open the Unity project you’ve connected with Bezi
3. Open Unity Package Manager: Window menu \> `Package Manager`
4. Delete the Bezi plugin: open “Bezi Sidekick” in the Package Manager \> `Remove`
5. Reopen the Bezi app
6. Select the green `Install Unity Plugin` button from the bottom left corner
7. Click on the Unity project to see the Package Manager popup
8. The Unity plugin should now be updated\!

### **How do I reinstate a lost connection between Unity and Bezi?**

There are a few common reasons and fixes:

1. Check that you have reliable internet connection
2. Confirm both the Unity project and the Bezi app are open and connected
3. Confirm that the project selection dropdown shows the correct project name
4. If the connection indicator bar in Unity is red, click on it to retry the connection
5. Confirm you're running a Unity version that Bezi supports
