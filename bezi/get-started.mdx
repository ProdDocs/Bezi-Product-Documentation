Bezi is an independent application that connects to your Unity project. This enables us to use the existing project context to inform AI-based responses that are specific to your project and to keep all the work within Unity.

**Bezi (codename Sidekick) is in beta**.

Please post any issues or questions in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9). We'll reply as fast as possible. We many need to ask you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.

## Connect Bezi to Unity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your Unity version">
    The following Unity versions can support Bezi:

    - Best: **Unity 2022 LTS** (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)
    - Supported: **2021 LTS**
    - Supported with risk: **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1** (in active development by Unity, which can impact external apps)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Unity project and connect it to Bezi">
    1. Open the Unity project you want to connect to Bezi
    2. Return to Bezi
    3. Open the **Project Picker** dropdown
    4. Select the relevant Unity project
    5. If you don't see the project in the dropdown, click `Add project` at the bottom of the dropdown to manually add the project to Bezi

    <Tip>
      Both the Unity project and Bezi app must be open to use them together. We recommend a split screen to see both simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Bezi identified the Unity project">
    Check the **Unity Project Picker** in the Bezi menu bar to confirm Bezi identified and connected to the correct Unity project.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection status">
    When Unity and Bezi are connected, there will be a green bar in Unity's menu and a green dot in Bezi's menu. If the bar in Unity is red at first, **click the bar** to retry the connection.

    <Warning>
      **If either connection indicator is red, the connection must be reinstated for Bezi to work.**

## Keep the Bezi app and Unity connection up to date

When a new version of Bezi is released, a green button in the top menu will appear. Click the button to update Bezi before you start work in Bezi. This will update Bezi and the Unity plugin.

Occasionally Unity's Package Manager doesn't automatically update the plugin. If you recently updated Bezi and it doesn't seem to be working with Unity, follow these steps:

1. Close Bezi: right-click on the desktop app \> `Quit`
2. Open the Unity project you've connected with Bezi
3. Open Unity Package Manager: Window menu \> `Package Manager`
4. Delete the Bezi plugin: open "Bezi Sidekick" in the Package Manager \> `Remove`
5. Reopen the Bezi app
6. Select the green `Install Unity Plugin` button in the top bar
7. Click on the Unity project to see the Package Manager popup
