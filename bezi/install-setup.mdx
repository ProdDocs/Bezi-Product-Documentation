Bezi is a game dev tool with complete context of your Unity project. It indexes a Unity project in-real time, registering all the **assets, scenes, packages, codebase and more.** It uses LLMs to find and apply task-relevant context, so every response is specific to the work at hand.

Because Bezi connects to the project, we invest heavily in IP security to keep your project data safe. **<u>No project data is ever used to train models</u>**. We encourage you to review our security program and [security FAQs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/security). For security-related questions, email [security@bezi.com](mailto:security@bezi.com).

Studios and indie devs use Bezi to be more efficient, without compromising IP security. Give it a try and share your thoughts on [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9)!

## Connect Bezi with Unity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Bezi app">
    Confirm your app is open and you see the Get Started screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a Unity project ">
    1. Open the Unity project you want to connect
    2. Confirm the Unity project is in a folder with write permissions
    3. Return to Bezi
    4. Open the **Project Picker** dropdown in Bezi's menu bar \> select your project 
       1. If you don't see the desired project in the dropdown, click `Add Project` to manually add the Unity project to Bezi 
       2. If you can't find your Unity project, see [this documentation](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/troubleshooting#why-am-i-not-seeing-my-project-in-the-projects-dropdown%3F) 
    5. Check name in the **Project Picker** to confirm the right Unity project is connected

    <Tip>
      Both the Unity project and Bezi app must be open to use them together. We recommend a split screen to see both simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Bezi's Unity plugin" stepNumber={3}>
    Select the plugin `Install` button, located in step 2 of the Get Started flow.

    <Tip>
      If you run into trouble installing the plugin via the Bezi app, download the Unity plugin directly from our [Changelog](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/changelog).
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Unity permission to install" stepNumber={4}>
    After you've clicked `Install` in Bezi, return to the Unity project. Unity will ask for consent to install the plugin. Once granted, the Unity Package Manager popup will appear.

    You may also see a _"_**_Consent Request_**_"_ popup from Unity. It's completely safe to accept, as it only modifies some APIs in Bezi to match your Unity version. No personal files are affected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection status">
    To confirm the connection is established, check Unity's menu for a green dot next to the **Bezi icon** and Bezi's menu for green dot next to the **Unity icon**.

    If either is red, follow [these steps to fix a broken connection](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/troubleshooting#how-do-i-reinstate-a-lost-connection-between-unity-and-bezi%3F).

    <Warning>
      Both connection indicators **must** be green for Bezi to work.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync your project with Bezi" stepNumber={6}>
    The first time you connect Bezi to a new Unity project, it needs time to index the entire project. Do not prompt Bezi until Asset Sync is completed, otherwise you risk breaking the sync and receiving generic responses.

    See the [Asset Sync docs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/asset-sync) for more information on the process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learn how to use Bezi">
    [******Before you prompt Bezi, read these instructions.******](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/welcome#how-to-use-bezi) In 5 minutes or less, you learn how to prompt, use threads, and select the right Mode for a task.
