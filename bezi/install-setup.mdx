Bezi is a desktop application that connects to your Unity project. This connection enables Bezi to index your project in-real time, using context from all the **assets, scenes, packages, codebase and more** to provide project and task-specific support.

We invest heavily in keeping your project data safe and private. **<u>No project data is ever used to train models</u>**.

We love hearing from you! Join the community, share your work, and ask questions in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9).

## Connect Bezi to Unity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Bezi app">
    Confirm your app is open and you see the Get Started screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a Unity project ">
    1. Open the Unity project you want to connect
    2. Confirm the Unity project is in a folder with write permissions
    3. Return to Bezi
    4. Open the **Project Picker** dropdown in Bezi's menu bar \> select your project 5. If you don't see the desired project in the dropdown, click `Add Project` to manually add the Unity project to Bezi 5. If you can't find your Unity project, see [this documentation](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/troubleshooting#why-am-i-not-seeing-my-project-in-the-projects-dropdown%3F)
    5. Check name in the **Project Picker** to confirm the right Unity project is connected

    <Tip>
      Both the Unity project and Bezi app must be open to use them together. We recommend a split screen to see both simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Bezi's plugin in Unity" stepNumber={3}>
    Select the plugin `Install` button, located in step 2 of the Get Started flow.

    <Tip>
      If you run into trouble installing the plugin via the Bezi app, download the Unity plugin directly from our [Changelog](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/changelog).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Unity permission to install" stepNumber={4}>
    After you've clicked `Install` in Bezi, return to the Unity project. Unity will ask for consent to install the plugin. Once granted, the Unity Package Manager popup will appear.

    You may also see a _"_**_Consent Request_**_"_ popup from Unity. It's completely safe to accept, as it only modifies some APIs in Bezi to match your Unity version. No personal files are affected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection status">
    To confirm the connection is established, check Unity's menu for a green dot next to the **Bezi icon** and Bezi's menu for green dot next to the **Unity icon**. 

    If either is red, follow [these steps to fix a broken connection](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/troubleshooting#how-do-i-reinstate-a-lost-connection-between-unity-and-bezi%3F).

    <Warning>
      Both connection indicators **must** be green for Bezi to work.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync your project with Bezi" stepNumber={6}>
    The first time you connect Bezi to a new Unity project, it needs time to index the entire project. Do not prompt Bezi until Asset Sync is completed, otherwise you risk breaking the sync and receiving generic responses.

    See the [Asset Sync docs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/asset-sync) for more information on the process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare to prompt!">
    Before you prompt Bezi, we suggest you do the following:

    - Learn [how to prompt Bezi](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/prompt-guide) for optimal results
    - Learn how to [tag assets/scripts in prompts](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/reference-assets-in-prompts) for better results
    - Create your [custom Project Rules](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/project-rules)
