Bezi is an independent application that connects to your Unity project. This enables Bezi to index your project and the existing context to return responses that are specific to your project.

Please post any issues or questions in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9). We'll reply as fast as possible. We many need to ask you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.

## Connect Bezi to Unity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your Unity version">
    Make sure you're running a Unity version that Bezi supports:

    - **Unity 6**
    - **Unity 2023**
    - **Unity 2022**
    - **Unity 2021**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a Unity project ">
    1. Open the Unity project you want to connect to Bezi
    2. Confirm the Unity project is in a folder with write permissions
    3. Return to Bezi
    4. Open the **Project Picker** dropdown \> select the project
    5. If you don't see the desired project in the dropdown, click `Add project` at the bottom of the dropdown to manually add a Unity project to Bezi
       1. If you can't find your Unity project, see [this documentation](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/troubleshooting#why-am-i-not-seeing-my-project-in-the-projects-dropdown%3F).

    <Tip>
      Both the Unity project and Bezi app must be open to use them together. We recommend a split screen to see both simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Bezi identified the Unity project">
    Check the **Project Picker**  in the Bezi menu bar to confirm Bezi identified the right Unity project.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Bezi plugin in Unity">
    Select the plugin `Install` button, located in the Get Started flow.

    <Tip>
      If you run into trouble installing the plugin via the Bezi app, you can download the Unity plugin directly from our [Changelog](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/changelog).
    </Tip>
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    The plugin `Install` button is also availabe in the bottom bar, which is where you'll receive notices for version updates outside of the onboarding flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection status">
    Once you've clicked `Install`, return to your Unity project. It will ask you for consent to install, then the Unity Package Manager popup will appear.

    You may also see a "**_Consent Request_**" popup from Unity at this stage. This popup is completely safe to accept, and will only modify the scripts that make Bezi; none of your personal files will be affected.

    The reason you see this popup is because we use some APIs in Bezi that can be auto-updated by Unity. This popuup just updates the APIs to reference the latest for whatever version of Unity you’re using.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection status">
    Once Unity and Bezi are connected, you will see a green dot next to the **Bezi icon** in Unity's menu and a green dot next to the Unity icon in Bezi's menu. If the bar in Unity is red at first, **click on the bar** to retry the connection.

    <Warning>
      If either connection indicator is red, the connection must be reinstated in order for Bezi to work.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync all project assets" stepNumber={7}>
    The first time you connect Bezi to a Unity project, it needs time to index the entire project. This enables Bezi to adapt all responses to your project. It’s important not to prompt Bezi until all project assets are successfully indexed, otherwise you risk receiving generic responses.

    See the Asset Sync docs for complete details.
