<Warning>
  **Agent Mode is in beta and active development**. If you're weary of how Agent Mode will work with your project, we recommend testing it in an example project first.
</Warning>

## What is Agent Mode?

Agent Mode is Bezi’s _actionable_ setting. It understands your entire Unity project and can create and modify scripts directly, simplifying the suggestion to implementation process. You can accept or reject proposed code, compare diffs, and immediately test suggestions in-Unity.

To enter Agent Mode, select the **mode dropdown** (below the prompt textbox) and select **Agent**. When you’re in Agent Mode, it will look like this:

</Frame>

## How's Agent Mode different than Ask Mode?

Agent Mode will directly implement changes in Unity on your behalf, while Ask Mode cannot. Consider Agent Mode as **automatic** implementation and [Ask Mode](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/ask-mode) as **manual** implementation.

## How do I use Agent Mode?

### Code generation and modification

All Agent Mode suggestions are implemented by default so you can test them in context before deciding to accept or reject them. When you receive a suggestion in Agent Mode, it's best practice to test the suggestion(s) in Unity, return to Bezi to accept what you like and/or reject what you don't, and then prompt again to iterate.

When Bezi suggests a script with the `accept` or `reject` option, it's been created and is viewable in Unity. This is what happens if you select either option:

1. `Accept`: this will not change anything, the script already exists in Unity and will stay as-is
2. `Reject`: this will remove any Bezi changes, either deleting new files created or reverting any changes made to an existing file

**Accepting or rejecting a suggestion is a non-reversible action**. Once either button is clicked, you can't return to the undecided state. If you wish to implement a suggestion you rejected, you can return to that section, copy it from the chat or in canvas, and manually implement it (as you would in Ask Mode).

If you don't accept or reject a suggestion and then submit a new prompt, the previous suggestion remaind **undecided** and therefore, changes are still present in your files. Further changes to that file lock the Accept/Reject buttons on previous iterations, so in order to return to or affect a previous undecided state, you have to reach a decision for all changes made to it since (moving backwards, chronologically).

- **Accepting** a later change to the same file accepts all prior undecided changes to that file which led to that state.
- **Rejecting** an individual change reverts that _most recent_ change, and "unlocks" the next-most recent undecided iteration, so that you may move backwards to a point that you liked and continue iteration from there.
- **Rejecting all** changes from the Asset Drawer rejects all iterations on that file, back to the last-planted flag— either the last version with accepted changes, or the version at the start of the thread of no new changes have been approved since.

### Diffs

We use **diffs** to indicate exactly what changes are being to files:

- **red highlights**: deletions made within a file
- **green highlights**: additions made within a file

In chat, modifications are shown compressed to be glanceable.

To view in the context of the entire script, open the script in **Canvas** (diffs will remain highlighted). This is intended to be a clearer way to show suggested changes in the script as a whole, so you can:

- Compare the update to the original, for confidence that Bezi’s doing the right thing
- Identify exactly where a change is being made, versus receiving a snippet out of context and having to guess where it fits into the larger script

### Asset Drawer

The Asset Drawer lists all created and modified files. It sits above the prompt box so you can view all changes made in the duration of a thread in one place and bulk accept or reject a response's suggestions.

### Restore Checkpoint

Once a suggestion is accepted or rejected, that suggestion cannot be reverted back to an undecided state.

If you wish to revert the entire project to a overall prior state, select the `Restore Checkpoint` button to go back to a specific conclusive state, identified by a Bezi response.

For example, if you go down a rabbit hole working on a particular mechanic, only to get feedback that your second iteration is the right direction; you can restore to that response and continue to iterate from there.

<Note>
  Restore Checkpoint does not revert actionable code to undecided. It returns you to a conclusive point in time, erasing any new code and/or code modifications made by Bezi after the point.
</Note>

This functionality is similar to the [Edit Prompt](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/edit-prompts) functionality, but it allows you to return to a specific response without anything regenerating (whereas with Editing, you have to modify a prompt and therefore regenerate it’s results to return to that point).
