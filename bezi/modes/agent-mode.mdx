<Warning>
  **Agent Mode is in beta and active development**. If you're weary of how Agent Mode will work with your project, we recommend testing it in an example project first.
</Warning>

## What is Agent Mode?

Agent Mode is Bezi’s _actionable_ setting. It understands your entire Unity project and can create and modify scripts directly, simplifying the suggestion to implementation process. You can accept or reject proposed code, compare diffs, and immediately test suggestions in-Unity.

To enter Agent Mode, select the **mode dropdown** (below the prompt textbox) and select **Agent**. When you’re in Agent Mode, it will look like this:

## How's Agent Mode different than Ask Mode?

Agent Mode will directly implement changes in Unity on your behalf, while Ask Mode cannot. Consider Agent Mode as **automatic** implementation and Ask Mode as **manual** implementation.

## How do I use Agent Mode?

### Code generation and modification in Agent Mode

All Agent Mode suggestions are implemented by default so you can test them in context before deciding to accept or reject them. When you receive a suggestion in Agent Mode, it's best practice to test the suggestion(s) in Unity, return to Bezi to accept what you like and/or reject what you don't, and then prompt again to iterate.

When Bezi suggests a script with the `accept` or `reject` option, it's been created and is viewable in Unity. This is what happens if you select either option:

1. `Accept`: this will not change anything, the script already exists in Unity and will stay as-is
2. `Reject`: this will remove any Bezi changes, either deleting new files created or reverting any changes made to an existing file

**Accepting or rejecting a suggestion is a non-reversible action**. Once either button is clicked, you can't return to the undecided state. If you wish to implement a suggestion you rejected, you can return to that section, copy it from the chat or in canvas, and manually implement it (as you would in Ask Mode).

If you don't accept or reject a suggestion and then submit a new prompt, the previous suggestion is **rejected by default**. Therefore, if you like a suggestion but want to iterate on it, we recommend accepting the suggestion to “plant your flag” and submit a new prompt to iterate on the accepted suggestion. 

### Diffs

We use **diffs** to indicate exactly what changes are being to files: 

- **red highlights**: deletions made within a file
- **green highlights**: additions made within a file 

In chat, modifications are shown compressed to be glanceable. 

To view in the context of the entire script, open the script in **Canvas** (diffs will remain highlighted). This is intended to be a clearer way to show suggested changes in the script as a whole, so you can:

- Compare the update to the original, for confidence that Bezi’s doing the right thing
- Identify exactly where a change is being made, versus receiving a snippet out of context and having to guess where it fits into the larger script

### Asset Drawer

The Asset Drawer lists all created and modified files. It sits above the prompt box so you can view all changes made in the duration of a thread in one place and bulk accept or reject a response's suggestions.

### Restore checkpoint 

Once a suggestion is accepted or rejected, that suggestion cannot be reverted back to an undecided state. 

However, if you wish to revert to an overall prior state of the project, the `Restore Checkpoint` button can take you back to the a specific conclusive state that you liked. For example, say you went down a rabbit hole working on a particular mechanic, only to get feedback that your second iteration was the right direction; you can restore to that response and continue to iterate from there.

Notably, Restore Checkpoint does not revert any actionable code to undecided; it returns you instead to that conclusive point in time so that you can proceed from solid ground.

This functionality is similar to the Edit Prompt option, but it allows you to return to a specific _response_ without anything regenerating (whereas with Editing, you have to modify a prompt and therefore regenerate it’s results to return to that point).
