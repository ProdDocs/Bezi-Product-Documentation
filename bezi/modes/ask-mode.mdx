## What is Ask Mode?

Ask Mode is Bezi’s _informational_ setting. It serves as a core knowledgebase, providing information, tutorials, and code snippets (that must be implemented through manual copy/paste) to walk you through an implementation or explanation. That lack of direct implementation is the primary distinction from Agent Mode: consider it the **manual** to Agent Mode’s **automatic**.
