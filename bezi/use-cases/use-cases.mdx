# Code

Generate and iterate on scripts. Direct-from-Unity context enables Bezi to make suggestions in full awareness of your entire project, so responses can avoid pitfalls like redundancies, repetition, and inconsistency.

Bezi can help you ‘mass in’ the core fundamentals, so you can focus on the bespoke mechanics; it can help you mock up those mechanics when you aren’t sure how to approach them; and it can simplify small busy work, turning thirty minutes of endless scrolling, copy/pasting, editing, and testing into thirty seconds.

### **Foundational systems**:

- “_Make a first person character controller with mouse-based camera movement_”
- “_Mock up object pooling for the obstacles and set up the basic obstacle ‘spawning’ and movement system (right to left)_”

### **Experimental whitebox mechs**:

- “_Prototype a ghost possession mechanic that lets the player take and relinquish control of other characters when in range and spacebar is pressed_”
- “_I want a camera system that moves to a fixed CameraLocation when they enter a collider tagged FixedCam, then lerps back to third person when out— what would that code look like?_”

### **Adjustments and additions**:

- “_Add crouch and jump behavior to the player movement script_”
- “_Instead of using a Raycast to detect treasure, can we use a collider on the @Hunter?_”
- “_Incorporate the isFalling, isFlying, and isMoving animation bools from @Sarah.controller into CharacterControls.cs_”

# Debug

Troubleshoot errors, whether they’re lighting up the console or glitching out your gameplay. Bezi is backed by scripting expertise, Unity docs, and all indexed contents of your project, so it can decipher and diagnose Console Error gibberish; pinpoint the components and/or scripts behind unexpected behaviors; and expose sources of lag so you can better ID and correct slow-downs.

### Console errors

- “_What’s up with that NullReference exception?_”
- “_How do you fix ‘We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.’?_”
- “_I made this shader but now I’m getting this endless loop of errors— why?_”

### Behavioral issues

- “_When I press play, the whole sky turns red. Is it the cloud render feature?_”
- “_My character vibrates and hops when stationary on a slanted surface_”
- “_Why does the portal gun not work in the Entry scene?_”

### Optimization

- “_Every time the player enters the Dungeon level, the framerate plummets. Why?_”
- “_How can I optimize the searching part of Seeker.cs?_”
- “_Optimize my project for mobile_”

# Internal Tools

Build internal tools to easily scale and automate repetitive Unity work, like creating levels and implementing asset.

For repetitive workflows and outputs, simply outline the process, ideal result, any customization levers, and tool user’s Unity proficiency. Then prompt Bezi to build a custom tool that enables anyone to manage tedious game dev work to spec.

### **Custom Editors**

- _“Create a custom editor with buttons to draw, shuffle, and discard cards for testing in play mode”_
- _“Create a custom editor to add tiles in the west, north, east, south directions from the current tile”_
- _“Add a custom editor to control the values of my shader”_

### **Scene visualizations**

- “_Add debug visualization of the locations where the enemies will spawn in the next wave”_
- _“Add a debug visualization of the spherical hotspots which trigger the next event”_

# Learn

Get concise, thorough project- and documentation-rooted answers. When you’re struggling to understand a Unity intricacy, walking through an unfamiliar script, or working with a new plugin, the sheer volume of info to wade through can be overwhelming and tough to extrapolate. Bezi combines its deep knowledge of your project with Unity docs, ReadMes, and other web resources to give detailed explanations. Before spending hours in the rabbit hole that is Stack, Reddit, and uncommented code, try using Bezi to synthesize relevant info.

### Unity info

- “_What’s the difference between a MeshRenderer and a SkinnedMeshRenderer?_”
- “_What are the main differences between Unity 6 and Unity 2022?_”
- “_Teach me about the core tabs of the Lighting window— specifically, what are Adaptive Probe Volumes?_”

### Packages

- “_Explain the key features of the PortalsForVR package_”
- “_Best packages for stylized water (provide Pros, Cons, and recommendations)_”
- “_How can I set up my project for Passthrough with MetaXR?_”

### How-tos

- “_How do you use set up custom sprites to use with a TileMap?_”
- “_Tutorial for making an inventory system for a desktop exploration game_”
- “_How do you use the Profiler?_”

### Existing assets

- “_Walk me through PlayerInteraction.cs_”
- “_How does the multiplayer system in this game work?_”
- “_What are the controls for this game? List what mechanics there are, and explain how to use each to test._”

# Search

Simplify the process of hunting through assets, scenes, and scripts— no parameter is too specific. Bezi understands the contents of your project, the objects in your scene, and the properties on your assets, so it’s equipped to help you parse through it all to find what you need.

Ask Bezi to find the little details that could take endless time to recover (like, “where is this method called?” and “what objects have this box checked?”).

<Warning>
  Currently, Bezi’s context does **<u>not</u>** dive into node graphs/state machines/visual scripting, so while Bezi will know that they’re there, it can’t see how such objects as animators and shader graphs are set up.
