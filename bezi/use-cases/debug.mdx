Bezi's foundation of scripting expertise, Unity docs, and all indexed contents of your project makes it very effective for sifting through projects to find causes and identify viable solutions for tricky bugs. Let Bezi search so you can work on other stuff.

Prompt it to decipher and diagnose Console Error gibberish; pinpoint the components and/or scripts behind unexpected behaviors; and expose sources of lag so you can ID and correct slow-downs faster.

## Example prompts

**Console errors**:

- _“What’s up with that NullReference exception?”_
- _“How do you fix ‘We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.’?”_
- _“I made this shader but now I’m getting this endless loop of errors— why?”_

**Behavioral issues**:

- _“When I press play, the whole sky turns red. Is it the cloud render feature?”_
- _“My character vibrates and hops when stationary on a slanted surface”_
- _“Why does the portal gun not work in the Entry scene?”_

**Optimization**:

- _“Every time the player enters the Dungeon level, the framerate plummets. Why?”_
- _“How can I optimize the searching part of Seeker.cs?”_
- _“Optimize my project for mobile”_
