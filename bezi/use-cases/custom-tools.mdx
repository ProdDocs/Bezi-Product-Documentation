Easily scale and automate repetitive Unity workflows and outputs, like creating levels and implementing asset.

Anyone can create tools with Bezi, wielding the power to unblock workflows when programmers are busy or pre-built tools don't meet your exact requirement.

## How to create custom tools

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Agent Mode">
    See the [Agent Mode docs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draft your prompt">
    In <u>as much detail as possible</u>, explain: the process you want to automate, any key inputs or variables Bezi should include, and the ideal outcome - what form the tool should take and what the output of using it should look like. See example prompts below.

    Tag specific project assets or scripts in your prompt ([type @, then the name](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/reference-assets-in-prompts)) to ensure Bezi factors them into the tool.

    Make sure your prompt clearly instructs Bezi to use this information to build a custom tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set-up and iterate">
    Bezi will create all required scripts for the tool. It will also give you step-by-step explanations for how to use the tool. In some cases, this might include attaching some scripts in-scene.

    Once set-up, test the tool and prompt Bezi in the same thread to make any required changes. 

    If the tool has an editor window, make sure you pin it in Bezi so the interface stays up-to-date with any changes. If your thread is getting too long, make a new thread, pin all relevant scripts, and resume iteration.
  </Step>

## Example prompts

**Object configurations:**

- _“Make a setup script to add all necessary components (@AnimalController.cs, Rigidbody, Collider) to an animal on play. Include a dropdown for all animal types in @Animals folder, and add the selected animal-type script.”_
- _“Create a ragdoll generator that I can attach to an object to setup configurable joints on it and all of its children.”_

**Custom editors:**

- _“Create a canvas tool, where I can lay out and generate new levels. I want to be able to add tiles, with each tile corresponding to a different prefab; place them on the grid; and press a button that generates that layout in-scene.”_
- _“Create a custom editor with buttons to draw, shuffle, and discard cards for testing in play mode"_
- _“Add a custom editor to control the values of my shader”_

**Scene visualizations:**

- “_Add debug visualization of the locations where the enemies will spawn in the next wave”_
- _“Add a debug visualization of the spherical hotspots which trigger the next event”_
