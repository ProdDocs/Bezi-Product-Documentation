description: "Use Bezi to create custom Unity tools in minutes. "

Easily scale and automate repetitive Unity workflows and outputs, like creating levels and implementing asset. Enable anyone to manage tedious game dev work to spec.

## How to create custom tools:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Agent Mode">
    See the [Agent Mode docs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draft your prompt">
    In <u>as much detail as possible</u>, explain: the high-level process, each step of it, all inputs, variuables, or customizations Bezi may need, and the ideal result or outcome. See example prompts below.

    Tag specific project assets or scripts in your prompt ([type @, then the name](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/reference-assets-in-prompts)) to ensure Bezi factors them into the tool.

    Make sure your prompt clearly instructs Bezi to use this information to build a custom tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set-up and iterate">
    Bezi will create all required scripts for the tool. In certain cases, it may give you instructions to attach the tool script to something in Unity.

    Once set-up, test the tool and prompt Bezi in the same thread to make any required changes.
  </Step>
