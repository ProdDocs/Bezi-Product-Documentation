- **Start in Ask Mode** and explain the mechanic you want: inputs, variables, controller mappings, etc., and the result you want. Ask Bezi to identify gaps in your plan, then suggest possible answers
- **Switch to Agent Mode **when you feel like the vision is clear, then submit your detailed prompt
  - Don’t be afraid to iterate in either mode! All Agent Mode changes can be iterated or reverted
- Example prompt to add the ability to temporarily blind another player by shining a flashlight in their eyes:
  - _“I want to create a mechanic to blind another player by shining a flashlight in their eyes. If I’m holding a lit flashlight and I point it directly at the front of their head, within a range and unobstructed, they should see a bright flash of white, quickly transitioning to black, and fading back in through a widening vignette over the course of 10 seconds. Their eyes should go totally emissive white when blind, and fade back to normal over the course of those 10 seconds.”_
