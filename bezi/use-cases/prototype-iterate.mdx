Complete context means Bezi can implement or update features that _will_ work with the existing project.

This means you can move straight from off-the-wall idea to testing in less time; and you can get the best variation of an idea out without sacrificing a deadline.

## How to prototype or iterate on features with Bezi

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Ask Mode">
    See the [**Ask Mode docs**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/ask-mode) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask Bezi to write you an implementation plan">
    In <u>as much detail as possible</u>, explain what you want to build: the ideal result, any key variables you’ll want to play with, and the controller scheme. At the end of the prompt, ask Bezi to write you an implementation plan for this feature.

    Tag specific project assets or scripts in your prompt ([**type @, then the name**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/reference-assets-in-prompts)) to ensure Bezi factors them into the plan. For example, if you want to add a throwing mechanic to your player interactions, pin the player interaction script and the character prefab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate on the implementation plan until it’s set">
    The goal is to have a comprehensive implementation plan, with minimal room for Bezi to make assumptions.

    If you want to use this implementation plan again, paste it into a [Page](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders) to quickly reference in future.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Agent Mode">
    Stay in the same thread you were iterating in and switch to Agent Mode.

    See the [**Agent Mode docs**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode) to learn more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tell Bezi to implement your feature">
    If you have a precise plan, your prompt can be as simple as "Implement this plan".

    If you're selecting from a few options, you can tell Bezi to "Implement option #2".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and iterate">
    Once the feature is mocked up, click into Unity to see it in action.

    If Bezi gave you implementation instructions, follow them to complete the set-up, then move into Unity for testing.

    Continue moving between Bezi and Unity, iterating on the mechanic and seeing the changes in action instantly.

    Make sure to keep and reject suggestions as you go. If you decide to revert the project to an earlier state, use the [Restore Checkpoint](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode#restore-checkpoint) button.

## Example prompts

**Foundational systems**:

- _“Make a first person character controller with mouse-based camera movement”_
- _“Mock up object pooling for the obstacles and set up the basic obstacle ‘spawning’ and movement system (right to left)”_

**Experimental whitebox mechs**:

- _“Prototype a ghost possession mechanic that lets the player take and relinquish control of other characters when in range and spacebar is pressed”_
- _“I want a camera system that moves to a fixed CameraLocation when they enter a collider tagged FixedCam, then lerps back to third person when out”_

**Adjustments and additions**

- “_Add crouch and jump behavior to the player movement script_”
- “_Instead of using a Raycast to detect treasure, can we change that to use the hunter collider?_”
- “_Incorporate the isFalling, isFlying, and isMoving animation bools from @Character.controller into CharacterController.cs_”
