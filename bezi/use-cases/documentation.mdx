title: "Understanding a Project"
description: "Onboard to a new project or get custom feature documentation in a heartbeat."

Bezi understands the contents of your project, the objects in your scene, and the properties on your assets, so it’s well-equipped to parse through it all and deliver you with any information you need.

Ask Bezi to navigate the depths of your project and find the little details that could take endless time to recover (like, “where is this used?” and “what objects have this box checked?”).

<Warning>
  Currently, Bezi’s context does NOT dive into node graphs, state machines, or visual scripting. Bezi is aware they exist, but cannot see or explain how objects like animators and shader graphs are set up.
