title: "Documenting and Explaining Projects"
description: "Onboard to a new project and get custom documentation in a heartbeat."
---

Bezi understands the contents of a project, the objects in a scene, and the properties on the assets, so it’s well-equipped to parse through it all and deliver the exact information you need.

Ask Bezi to navigate the depths of your project to find the little details that take endless time to recover. And breathe easy knowing project documentation is covered, without spending time on it.

<Warning>
  Currently, Bezi’s context does NOT dive into node graphs, state machines, or visual scripting. Bezi is aware they exist, but cannot see or explain how objects like animators and shader graphs are set up.
</Warning>
