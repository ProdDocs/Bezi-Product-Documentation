title: "Document and Explain Projects"
description: "Onboard to a new project and get custom documentation in a heartbeat."
---

Bezi understands the contents of a project, the objects in a scene, and the properties on the assets, so it’s well-equipped to parse through it all and deliver the exact information you need.

Ask Bezi to navigate the depths of your project to find the little details that take endless time to recover. And breathe easy knowing project documentation is covered, without spending time on it.

<Warning>
  Currently, Bezi’s context does NOT dive into node graphs, state machines, or visual scripting. Bezi is aware they exist, but cannot see or explain how objects like animators and shader graphs are set up.
</Warning>

If you want to use Bezi to track and document how a feature, system or project evolves over time, follow these steps: 

1. Prompt Bezi to write detailed documentation for the scope in question
2. Copy and paste the in-thread documentation into a [Page](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders)
3. Title the Page according to the scope and date
4. Ask Bezi to generate documentation on how the current version is different from the original, tagging the Page you created so Bezi knows to use it as the "origional" datapoint 
   1. _"Write me detailed documentation on the current version of @[scope] and how it is different from the origional @[Page-name]"_
5. Voila! Bezi's written your detailed documentation and changelog
