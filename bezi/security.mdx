## **How does Bezi define "project data"?**

Project data is scripts and assets in a Unity project that has been connected to Bezi.

## **What project data does Bezi ingest?**

Bezi syncs the scripts and assets in the connected Unity project.

We only sync the project data required to provide contextually-relevant responses - i.e. generate code or actions that make sense and work with the existing project.

## **Is my project data used to train any of the LLM provider’s models?**

Never. When an AI request is made, LLM providers will see project data needed to help generate a response or output to your prompt, but our licenses with these providers ensure that your data will not be used to train their models.

## **How is project data stored by Bezi, for how long?**

For optimal application performance, scripts and select assets are cached securely on our AWS infrastructure, which is covered by our SOC2 Type2 certification, for up to 7 days.

## **How is my project data handled and secured during transit and in cache?**

We use secure protocols for project data transfer. All project data is encrypted in flight and at rest on our AWS storage infrastructure.

## **What personal data does Bezi collect and how is it stored?**

See our [Privacy Policy](https://www.bezi.com/privacy-policy) for complete information on what personal data is collected and how it is protected by Bezi.

## **Who owns the project data created by Bezi?**

You own all scripts and actions generated by Bezi.
