description: "Pin must-have context in a prompt to improve the speed and accuracy of Bezi's response"
---

Pin context (assets, scripts, Pages, etc) in prompts to guaruntee that important context is included from the start, so Bezi can generate the best response faster. If you _know_ something is essential, pin it. This is extra important in large projects with thousands to millions of assets, scripts, etc.

## What can be pinned in a prompt?

Any context Bezi gathers can be referenced in a prompt. This includes in-Unity context (scripts, models, packages, etc.) and out-of-Unity context (Pages).

## How to pin in your prompt

### Type @ symbol while writing prompt

To in-line pin in your prompt, type @ then 3+ characters to trigger the search pop-up. The search popup will filter options based on the characters you type.

### Pills (proposed pins based on what's selected in Unity)

Anything actively selected in your Unity project shows up as **pills** (proposed pins) above the prompt input field.

Pills are not active pins. **You need to select the pill to transform it into a pin. **Pills are dark and have a dotted border. Pins are bright and have a solid border. 

To disable a pin and remove it from the context, select it and confirm it has the pill border/color again.
