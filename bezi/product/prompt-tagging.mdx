title: "Prompt Pins"
description: "Pin must-have context in a prompt to improve the speed and accuracy of Bezi's response"

Pin context (assets, scripts, Pages, etc) in prompts to guaruntee that important context is included from the start, so Bezi can generate the best response faster. If you _know_ something is essential, pin it. This is extra important in large projects with thousands to millions of assets, scripts, etc.

## What can be pinned in a prompt?

Any context Bezi gathers can be referenced in a prompt. This includes in-Unity context (scripts, models, packages, etc.) and out-of-Unity context (Pages).

## How to pin in your prompt

### Type @ symbol while writing prompt

When writing a prompt in Bezi's input field, you can type @ for in-line tagging. Typing 3 or more characters will trigger the search popup, which automatically filters to show a list suggestions relevant to your input.

### Click the @ icon above the input field

You can also find and add tags as references by clicking on the `@` icon above the input field. This will open up a popup menu with a search field.

### Pills

If you have anything selected in your Unity project, those will show up as **pills** above the input field. They'll have a dotted line to indicate that they're not yet tagged in the prompt.

Click on any pills that you want to add as tags in the prompt. In turn, clicking on an "active" pills will remove it as a tag.
