## What are image attachments

The ability to add images or screenshots to a prompt to supplement the information Bezi factors into its response.

## When to use image attachments

Image attachments are helpful in situations where you want to provide Bezi with specific visual context or direction. You can show Bezi things it cannot see in Unity or that exist outside of your project.

Examples include (**<u>but are not limited to</u>**) when you want to:

- use Bezi to fix errors in the Console, Unity Inspector, Unity's Player Settings & Preferences (_Bezi has limited visibility into these areas in Unity_)
- ask questions related to Unity Profiler and optimizations (_Bezi has limited visibility into this in Unity_)
- use Bezi to debug issues seen in Play Mode
- give Bezi visual references to copy when creating things for UI or level design
- find specific references/assets from an image within your project

## Before you upload

You can attach image files up to **5 MB** and **8000x8000 px**. Any files over those limits will be blocked.

These are the supported image file formats: **JPEG**, **PNG**, **WebP**, and **GIF**. Since GIFs are a collection of images, Bezi can only analyze the first frame.

Bezi will analyze all attached images according to your prompt instructions when formulating its response. We recommend telling Bezi what aspects of the image(s) you want it to focus on and what it should do with the information.

You can attach up to 3 images in a single prompt, in case you want Bezi to compare or contrast images.

## How to upload

Click the attachment icon in the prompt box and select the image file. Repeat this process to attach multiple images (up to 3).
