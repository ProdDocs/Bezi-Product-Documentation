Threads are a series of prompts and responses between you and Bezi. Each project used with Bezi has its own thread history. Switching between Unity projects will change the threads you see in the History panel.

<Note>
  **For optimal responses, keep threads short and focused on 1 topic**.

  When prompting in a thread with long or multi-task prompt history, Bezi may accidentally reference the wrong information when processing the response.
</Note>

**Access threads**: select the  <Icon icon="sidebar" iconType="regular" color="#020202" />  icon in the top left of the app

**Start a new thread**: select the **\+** icon in the Threads section

**View a thread split-screen with Pages/Rules**: select the <Icon icon="sidebar-flip" iconType="regular" color="#000000" /> icon in the top right of the thread view

**Reopen old threads:** click on any thread name to reopen it. You can scroll through the previous responses for information to reuse or submit new prompts to pick up the conversation where you left off.

If you submit a prompt in one thread then open another thread (existing or new), the prompt will cancel. To avoid spending credits on canceled prompts, wait for the prompt response before leaving the existing thread.
