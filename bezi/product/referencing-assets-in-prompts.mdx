Tagging assets in a prompt ensures that important context doesn’t get missed and will help get the best response faster\! If you _know_ something is essential, tagging it ensures that Bezi will reference it. This is especially helpful in larger projects with tens of thousands to millions of assets.

## What can be referenced in a prompt?

Any project context Bezi indexes can be referenced in a prompt. This includes scripts, models, packages, and more.

## How to reference an asset in your prompt
