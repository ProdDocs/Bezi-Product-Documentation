## Code

Generate and iterate on scripts. Direct-from-Unity context enables Bezi to make suggestions in full awareness of your entire project, so responses can avoid pitfalls like redundancies, repetition, and inconsistency.

Bezi can help you ‘mass in’ the core fundamentals, so you can focus on the bespoke mechanics; it can help you mock up those bespoke mechanics when you aren’t sure how to approach a new idea; and it can simplify small busy work, turning thirty minutes of endless scrolling, rewriting and pasting, and testing/retesting into thirty seconds.

### **Foundational systems**: 

- “_Make a first person character controller with mouse-based camera movement_”
- “_Mock up object pooling for the obstacles and set up the basic obstacle ‘spawning’ and movement system (right to left)_”

### **Experimental whitebox mechs**: 

- “_Prototype a ghost possession mechanic that lets the player take and relinquish control of other characters when in range and spacebar is pressed_”
- “_I want a camera system that moves to a fixed CameraLocation when they enter a collider tagged FixedCam, then lerps back to third person when out_”

### **Adjustments and additions**: 

- “_Add crouch and jump behavior to the player movement script_”
- “_Instead of using a Raycast to detect treasure, can we change that to use the hunter collider?_”
- “_Incorporate the isFalling, isFlying, and isMoving animation bools from @Character.controller into CharacterController.cs_”
