## Code

Generate and iterate on scripts. Direct-from-Unity context enables Bezi to make suggestions in full awareness of your entire project, so responses can avoid pitfalls like redundancies, repetition, and inconsistency.

Bezi can help you ‘mass in’ the core fundamentals, so you can focus on the bespoke mechanics; it can help you mock up those bespoke mechanics when you aren’t sure how to approach a new idea; and it can simplify small busy work, turning thirty minutes of endless scrolling, rewriting and pasting, and testing/retesting into thirty seconds.

### **Foundational systems**: 

- “_Make a first person character controller with mouse-based camera movement_”
- “_Mock up object pooling for the obstacles and set up the basic obstacle ‘spawning’ and movement system (right to left)_”

### **Experimental whitebox mechs**: 

- “_Prototype a ghost possession mechanic that lets the player take and relinquish control of other characters when in range and spacebar is pressed_”
- “_I want a camera system that moves to a fixed CameraLocation when they enter a collider tagged FixedCam, then lerps back to third person when out_”

### **Adjustments and additions**: 

- “_Add crouch and jump behavior to the player movement script_”
- “_Instead of using a Raycast to detect treasure, can we change that to use the hunter collider?_”
- “_Incorporate the isFalling, isFlying, and isMoving animation bools from @Character.controller into CharacterController.cs_”

## Debug

Troubleshoot errors, whether they’re lighting up the console or glitching in your gameplay. Bezi is backed by scripting expertise, Unity docs, and all indexed contents of your project, so it can decipher and diagnose Console Error gibberish; pinpoint the components and/or scripts behind unexpected behaviors; and expose sources of lag so you can better ID and correct slow-downs.

### Console errors

- “_What’s up with that NullReference exception?_” 
- “_How do you fix ‘We can't assign a new GUID because the asset is in an immutable folder. The asset will be ignored.’?_”
- “_I made this shader but now I’m getting this endless loop of errors— why?_”

### Behavioral issues

- “_When I press play, the whole sky turns red. Is it the cloud render feature?_”
- “_My character vibrates and hops when stationary on a slanted surface_”
- “_Why does the portal gun not work in the Entry scene?_”

### Optimization

- “_Every time the player enters the Dungeon level, the framerate plummets. Why?_”
- “_How can I optimize the searching part of Seeker.cs?_”
- “_Optimize my project for mobile_”
