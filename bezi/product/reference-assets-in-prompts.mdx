Referencing assets in a prompt ensures that important context doesnâ€™t get missed and will help get the best response faster. If you _know_ something is essential, tagging it ensures that Bezi will reference it. This is especially helpful in larger projects with tens of thousands to millions of assets.

## What can be referenced in a prompt?

Any project context Bezi indexes can be referenced in a prompt. This includes scripts, models, packages, and more.

## How to reference an asset in your prompt

### Type @ symbol while writing prompt

When writing a prompt in Bezi's input field, you can type @ to tag assets in-line. Typing 3 or more characters will trigger the search popup, which automatically filters to show a list suggestions relevant to your input.

### Click the @ icon above the input field

You can also find and add assets as references by clicking on the `@` icon above the input field. This will open up a popup menu with a search field.

### Pills

If you have any assets selected in your Unity project, those will show up as **pills** above the input field. They'll have a dotted line to indicate that they're not yet tagged as references in the prompt.

Click on any pills that you want to add as references in the prompt. In turn, clicking on an "active" pills will remove it as a reference.
