Threads are a series of prompts and responses between you and Bezi.

<Info>
  **For optimal response quality, keep threads short and focused on one (1) topic or task**. The longer a thread, the higher likelihood that Bezi will reference irrelevant historical information when trying to process a response to a new prompt. 
</Info>

To access your thread history, click the  <Icon icon="sidebar" iconType="solid" color="#020202" />  icon in the top left of your app to open the Sidebar. Within the Sidebar, select `Threads` to access your thread history for this Unity project.

Each project youâ€™ve used Bezi with has its own thread history, so switching between Unity projects using the Project Picker dropdown will switch the threads you see in the History panel.

Click on any thread in the History panel to reopen it. You can scroll through the previous responses for information you want to reuse or submit new prompts to pick up the conversation where you left off. If you submit a prompt in one thread then move to another thread (existing or new), that prompt will be canceled. To avoid spending a credit on a canceled prompt, wait to receive a response to the prompt before switching to a different thread.
