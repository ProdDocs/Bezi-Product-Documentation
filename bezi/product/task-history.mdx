A task is a thread of prompts and responses between you and Bezi. 

To access your task history, click the `history` icon in the top left of the toolbar. This will open the History panel, which has a complete record of all tasks for the Unity project you're currently connected to. Each project youâ€™ve connected in Bezi has its own task History, so switching between Unity projects in the Project Picker dropdown will switch the History panel. 

You can click on any task in the History panel to reopen it. You can continue the conversation that was happening in this task, or scroll through to find information you want to reuse.
