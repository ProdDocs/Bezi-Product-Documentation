**A task is a thread of prompts and responses between you and Bezi.**

To access your task history, click the `History` icon in the top left of the toolbar. This will open the History panel, which has a complete record of all tasks for the currently active Unity project.

Each project youâ€™ve used Bezi with has its own task history, so switching between Unity projects using the Project Picker dropdown will switch the tasks you see in the History panel. 

Click on any task in the History panel to reopen it. You can scroll through the previous responses for information you want to reuse or submit new prompts to pick up the conversation where you left off. If you submit a prompt in one task then move to another task (existing or new), that prompt will be canceled. To avoid spending a credit on a canceled prompt, wait to receive a response to the prompt before switching to a different task.
