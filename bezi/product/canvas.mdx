## What's Canvas? 

Canvas is another way to view certain parts of Bezi responses (at present, code and text documents) alongside the chat view. This allows you to review scripts in full, side-by-side with their explanations and/or implementation instructions. 

This is especially powerful in Agent Mode, as it allows you to see diffs and suggested changes in the context of the full scriptâ€” and is helpful across the board, as it presents all key info in a single, readable layout.
