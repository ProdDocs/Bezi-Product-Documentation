## What's Canvas?

Canvas is another way to view certain parts of a Bezi response (at present, code and text documents) alongside the chat view. This allows you to review scripts in full, side-by-side with their explanations and/or implementation instructions.

Canvas is especially powerful in Agent Mode because it allows you to see diffs and suggested changes in the context of the full script.

## How do I access Canvas?

Canvas is available in **Ask Mode** and **Agent Mode** and is accessed differently in both. To close in eitehr situation, just select the `X` in the top bar.

**Ask Mode:** select the expand button at the top of a script

**Agent Mode**: select the script title (very short, non-agentic code snippets cannot be opened)

## Diffs

When working in Agent Mode, Canvas is great for seeing changes in the context of the entire script and accept or reject them from there.

## Tabs

<Warning>
  **The tabs feature is still in development**, particularly for Ask Mode. For example, you may encounter tabs with “Untitled” names. Please consider the current version a work-in-progress\!
</Warning>

Canvas uses **tabs** to navigate between scripts returned in a response. When you open a script from one response, all the tabs will update to show only the scripts returned in that response, _at the state that they were for that query_.

For example, if you’ve been iterating on Script A and you want to compare the present version to a previous iteration, you can navigate to the previous message and view the script as it was returned there. This history navigation helps you to make compare versions and, as needed, informed decisions about reversion.
