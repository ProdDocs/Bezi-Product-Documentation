## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store and manage important information about your game. Bezi can use this information to make responses more consistent and specific to your game’s goals.

The Pages interface is a text editor and each Page has a 10,000 character limit.

## How to use Pages for prompt context

To include Pages in a specific prompt’s context, follow the same process as referencing an asset in the prompt. Type @[page name], press `enter` to select, and continue writing your prompt.

If you want this Page to included in the context of an entire thread, pin the page to the prompt box.

<Warning>
  **You must tag or pin a Page for it to be included in Bezi’s context**. Bezi isn’t able to automatically include all Pages in its context yet, like how Project Rules work, but it's on the roadmap.
