## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store and manage important information about your game. Bezi can use this information to make responses more consistent and specific to your game’s goals.

The Pages interface is a text editor. Each Page has a 10,000 character limit. Only you can edit or modify Page content - Bezi cannot be prompted to do this on your behalf yet.

<Warning>
  **Tag Pages you want Bezi to reference in-prompt**. Bezi includes Pages in the context search, but tagging is still the only way to **<u>guaruntee</u>** a Page will be considered in the response.
</Warning>

If you want for a Page to included in the context of an entire thread, pin the page to the prompt box.

## What should I use Pages for?

Use Pages to store any game-specific decisions, plans, or documentation that you'll want Bezi to reference in future prompts or threads.

### Store Plans For Bezi to Execute On

Create an implementation plan with Bezi, then save it in a Page so Bezi can reference and execute on it. **Tag the Page in an Agent Mode prompt and ask Bezi to execute on your plan.**

- Define your core game mechanics (e.g., “Jumping uses stamina”)
- Outline level ideas with quick bullet points
- Plan your feature implementation

### Save Game-Wide Context to Tailor Bezi’s Output

Store meta-level game information, like GDDs or system architecture. Tag the Page in any prompts that require keeping the game’s end-state in mind. **Tag the Page in prompts that reference existing goals or patterns**

- Define key game strategy or plans, using Bezi to identify possible gaps
- Set pre-established game directions or patterns you want Bezi to follow across threads

## What are Folders?

Folders are where you organize Pages. To figure out which Folder an open Page lives in, check the top toolbar where the storage path is listed.

To manage the Folder or the Pages within it, hover over the Folder and click the `…` icon. You will see a menu of options to:

- Rename the Folder
- Move Pages in/out of the Folder
- Delete the Folder

<Warning>
  **Deleting a Folder will delete any Pages in the Folder**. Do not delete any Folders until you’ve confirmed all Pages have been moved.
</Warning>
