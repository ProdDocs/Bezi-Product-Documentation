## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store and manage important information about your game. Bezi can use this information to make responses more consistent and specific to your game’s goals.

The Pages interface is a text editor. Each Page has a 10,000 character limit.

## How to use Pages

To include Pages in a prompt’s context, follow the same process as referencing an asset in the prompt. Type @[page name], press `enter` to select, and continue writing your prompt.

If you want this Page to included in the context of an entire thread, pin the page to the prompt box.

<Warning>
  **You must tag or pin a Page for it to be included in Bezi’s context**. Bezi isn’t able to automatically include all Pages in its context yet, like how Project Rules work, but it's on the roadmap.
</Warning>

## What should I use Pages for?

Use Pages to store any game-specific decisions, plans, or documentation that you'll want Bezi to reference in future prompts or threads.

### **Store Plans For Bezi to Execute On**

Create an implementation plan with Bezi, then save it in a Page so Bezi can reference and execute on it. **Tag the Page in an Agent Mode prompt and ask Bezi to execute on your plan.**

- Define your core game mechanics (e.g., “Jumping uses stamina”)
- Outline level ideas with quick bullet points
- Plan your feature implementation

### **Save Game-Wide Context to Tailor Bezi’s Output**

Store meta-level game information, like GDDs or system architecture. Tag the Page in any prompts that require keeping the game’s end-state in mind. **Tag the Page in prompts that reference existing goals or patterns**

- Define key game strategy or plans, using Bezi to identify possible gaps
- Set pre-established game directions or patterns you want Bezi to follow across threads

### **Save Documentation to Track Project Updates **

Document a feature, system, or the entire project at a point in time and save it in a Page. **Tag the Page in a prompt and use Bezi to understand everything that's changed since**. 

- For complete documentation, ask Bezi to explain the project in detail and save it to a Page 
- For a detailed changelog, ask Bezi to write "Before" docs before you start. Once done, ask Bezi how the new state is different from the original, using the "Before" docs as a reference
- To track progress over time, ask Bezi to generate new documentation on a regular cadence

## What are Folders?

Folders are where you organize Pages. To figure out which Folder an open Page lives in, check the top toolbar where the storage path is listed.

To manage the Folder or the Pages within it, hover over the Folder and click the `…` icon. You will see a menu of options to:

- Rename the Folder
- Move Pages in/out of the Folder
- Delete the Folder

<Warning>
  **Deleting a Folder will delete any Pages in the Folder**. Do not delete any Folders until you’ve confirmed all Pages have been moved.
