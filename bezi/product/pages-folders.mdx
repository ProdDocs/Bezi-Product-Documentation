## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store and manage important information about your game. Bezi can use this information to make responses more consistent and specific to your game’s goals.

The Pages interface is a text editor and each Page has a 10,000 character limit.

## How to use Pages

1. Create a Page
2. Use `@` to tag the Page in prompts you want Bezi to reference it in
3. Pin the page(s) if they’re relevant for the entire thread

## What should I use Pages for?

Use Pages to document any game-specific decisions, plans, or information that you'll want Bezi to reference continuously in prompts or threads.

### **Store Plans For Bezi to Execute On**

Create an implementation plan with Bezi, then save it in a Page so Bezi can reference and execute on it.

- Define your core game mechanics (e.g., “Jumping uses stamina”).
- Outline level ideas with quick bullet points.
- Plan your feature implementation.
- **Tag the Page in an Agent Mode prompt and ask Bezi to execute on your plan.**

### **Save Game-Wide Context To Tailor Bezi’s Output**

Store meta-level game information, like GDDs or system architecture. Tag the Page in any prompts that require keeping the game’s end-state in mind.

- Define key game strategy or plans, using Bezi to identify possible gaps
- Set pre-established game directions or patterns you want Bezi to follow across threads
- **Tag the Page in prompts that reference existing goals or patterns**

## How to include Pages in prompt context

To include Pages in a specific prompt’s context, follow the same process as referencing an asset in the prompt. Type @[page name], press `enter` to select, and continue writing your prompt.

If you want this Page to included in the context of an entire thread, [pin the page](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/reference-assets-in-prompts#how-to-reference-an-asset-in-your-prompt) to the prompt box.

<Warning>
  **You must tag or pin a Page for it to be included in Bezi’s context**. Bezi isn’t able to automatically include all Pages in its context yet, like how Project Rules work, but it's on the roadmap.
</Warning>

## What are Folders?

Folders are where you organize Pages. To figure out which Folder an open Page lives in, check the top toolbar where the storage path is listed.

To manage the Folder or the Pages within it, hover over the Folder and click the `…` icon. You will see a menu of options to:

- Rename the Folder
- Move Pages in/out of the Folder
- Delete the Folder

<Warning>
  **Deleting a Folder will delete any Pages in the Folder**. Do not delete any Folders until you’ve confirmed all Pages have been moved.
</Warning>
