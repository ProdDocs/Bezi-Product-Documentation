Asset Sync is what enables Bezi to understand the pieces of your Unity project. That information is used by Bezi to deliver responses that are accurate and relevant to your project.

When connecting a Unity project to Bezi for the first time, Bezi will need time to index the project. Once the initial indexing is completed, Bezi will automatically index the project in real-time (as long as its connected) to keep responses relevant to the project.
