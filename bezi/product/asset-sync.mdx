title: "Asset Sync"
description: "How Bezi indexes your project to customize responses"
---

Asset sync enables Bezi to understand your Unity project and craft accurate, helpful responses.

<Warning>
  Do not prompt Bezi until asset sync is successfully completed. If your project hasn't been indexed, Bezi won't have complete context and you may get generic responses.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What parts of a project can Bezi index?">
    1. Scene structure and hierarchy (up to the last save)
    2. Scripts and code
    3. Assets and Resources, such as: _models, meshes, materials, textures, shaders, packages (including 3rd party packages), and more_
    4. Project settings, such as: _Unity version, render pipeline, renderer configuration, tags and layers setup, and project name_
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What parts of a project can Bezi NOT index?">
    Bezi is aware the following exist, but cannot see or explain how objects like animators and shader graphs are set up.

    1. Node graphs
    2. State machines
    3. Visual scripting: [___Bezi can't visually see a project like the human eye does. Attach an image to your prompt if you need it to see something visually.___](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/attach-images)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When connecting a Unity project to Bezi for the first time, Bezi will need time to index the project. Larger projects will need more time to index.

Once initial indexing is completed for a project, Bezi will automatically check for modifications to the project (while it's connected) and will update the context in real-time to keep responses relevant.

## Where to track asset's sync status

Track the project's asset sync status in the **Asset sync panel**. To open the Asset sync panel, click the <Icon icon="layer-group" iconType="solid" color="#020202" /> icon in the bottom bar.

## Tracking asset sync completion

Before opening the Asset sync panel, confirm the Bezi app and the Unity project are connected.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Asset sync panel icons">
    There are a few different icons you'll see in the Asset Sync queue that indicate an asset's indexing status.

    - <Icon icon="loader" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#080808" /> - this asset is in the process of indexing
    - <Icon icon="manhole" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#4bee32" /> - this asset has been successfully indexed
    - <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#f6e127" /> - this asset is taking a long time to sync, click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to restart the sync for it
    - <Icon icon="manhole" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#f31313" /> - this asset was not indexed (see Asset Sync issues section)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When asset sync is in progress

When asset sync is in progress, you’ll see a list of project assets to be indexed in the panel. Asset's status icons will update as they're indexed so you can track their progress in real time.

### When assets are done syncing

When Asset sync has indexed everything, the panel will say “_asset sync queue is empty_”.

However, **this does not mean all assets were successfully synced**.

### When all assets are successfully synced

To confirm all assets are successfully synced, check if the Asset Sync Error panel icon ( <Icon icon="bug" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#050404" /> ) has a red dot in it. If there's no red dot, you're ready to prompt Bezi!

## What if there are issues syncing my assets?

If there are issues syncing assets, the **Asset sync errors panel** icon (<Icon icon="bug" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#030303" />) will have a red dot in it. If this happens:

1. Open the Asset sync errors panel to see what the issue is
2. Return to the Asset sync panel
3. Click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to force an update

If the Asset sync errors persist, take the following steps to resolve possible project-level errors. If quitting the Bezi app resolves the errors, you do not need to uninstall the plugin.

1. Quit the Bezi app, reopen it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel
2. Uninstall the Bezi Unity plugin, reinstall it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel

If the Asset sync errors panel still shows error(s), take a screenshot of the Unity console log errors and email it to us at [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com) so we can help resolve it.
