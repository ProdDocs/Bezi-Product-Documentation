Asset sync enables Bezi to understand your Unity project and craft responses (scripts, bug fixes, suggestions) that are accurate and relevant for your project.

When connecting a Unity project to Bezi for the first time, Bezi will need time to index the project. Larger projects will need more time to index.

**Do not prompt Bezi until asset sync is successfully completed**. If your project hasn't been indexed, Bezi won't have complete context and you may get generic responses.

<Accordion title="What parts of a project can Bezi index? ">
  1. Scene structure and hierarchy
  2. Scripts and code
  3. Assets and Resources, such as: _models, meshes, materials, textures, shaders, packages (including 3rd party packages), and more_
  4. Project settings, such as: _Unity version, render pipeline, renderer configuration, tags and layers setup, and project name_
</Accordion>

Once initial indexing is completed for a project, Bezi will automatically index the project in real-time (when it's connected) to keep responses relevant to the project as it evolves.

## Where to track asset's sync status

Track Asset Sync's status for the project in the **Asset sync panel**. To open the Asset sync panel, click the <Icon icon="pancakes" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#020202" /> icon in the bottom bar.

## Tracking asset sync completion

Before opening the Asset sync panel, confirm the Bezi app and the Unity project are connected.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Asset sync panel icons">
    There are a few different icons you'll see in the Asset Sync queue that indicate an asset's indexing status.

    - <Icon icon="loader" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#080808" /> - this asset is in the process of indexing
    - <Icon icon="manhole" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#4bee32" /> - this asset has been successfully indexed
    - <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#f6e127" /> - there were issues with this asset, it may only be partially indexed
    - <Icon icon="manhole" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#f31313" /> - this asset was not indexed (see Asset Sync Errors panel for more information)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### When asset sync is in progress

When asset sync is in progress, you’ll see a list of all your project assets in the panel. Asset's status icons will update as they're indexed so you can track their progress in real time.

### When assets are done syncing 

When Asset Sync has processed everything, the panel will say “_asset sync queue is empty_”.

However, **this does not mean all assets were successfully synced**.

### When all assets are successfully synced 

To confirm all assets are successfully synced, check if the Asset Sync Error panel icon ( <Icon icon="bug" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#050404" /> ) has a red dot in it. If there's no red dot, you're ready to prompt Bezi\!

## What if there are issues syncing my assets? 

If there are issues syncing assets, the **Asset sync errors panel** icon (<Icon icon="bug" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#030303" />) will have a red dot in it. If this happens:

1. Open the Asset sync errors panel to see what the issue is
2. Return to the Asset sync panel
3. Click the refresh icon in the top left of the Asset sync panel to force an update

If this doesn't resolve the issues shown in the Asset sync errors panel, check the Unity console log for errors. These can point to system-level issues that prevent Bezi from successfully syncing some or all assets (examples below).

1. Bezi's Unity plugin experienced an issue during asset sync
2. There was an issue finding or scanning the Unity folder for assets
3. There was a server connection issue

If you see any of these errors, we recommend uninstalling and reinstalling Bezi's Unity plugin. If that doesn't resolve the Asset sync errors warning, email [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com) and we'll help to resolve it.
