Asset Sync is what enables Bezi to understand the pieces of your Unity project. That information is used by Bezi to deliver responses that are accurate and relevant to your project.

When connecting a Unity project to Bezi for the first time, Bezi will need time to index the project. Larger projects will need more time to index. 

**Do not prompt Bezi until Asset Sync is successfully completed**. If Asset Sync has not indexed your project's assets, Bezi won't have complete context and you may get generic responses.

<Accordion title="What types of asset can Bezi index? ">
  1. Scene structure and hierarchy
  2. Scripts and code
  3. Assets and Resources, such as: _models, meshes, materials, textures, shaders, packages (including 3rd party packages), and more_
  4. Project settings, such as: _Unity version, render pipeline, renderer configuration, tags and layers setup, and project name_
</Accordion>

Once initial indexing is completed for a project, Bezi will automatically index the project in real-time (when it's connected) to keep responses relevant to the project as it evolves.

## Where to track Asset Sync status for a connected project

Track Asset Sync's status for the project in the **Asset Sync panel**. To open the panel, click the `server` icon (image below), located in the bottom right of the Bezi app.

    - **Yellow triangle**: there were issues with this asset, it may only be partially indexed
