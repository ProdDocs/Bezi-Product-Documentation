</Update>

<Update label="10/28/2025" description>
  **Usability improvements:**

  - New: View threads and pages side by side
    - A substantial UI update paving the way for future features
    - Threads and pages can be switched independently
  - New: Sidebar drag and drop for pages
  - Update: Tag selection and pinning!!
    - If you have something selected in Unity, it will now show as **a suggested pill** that you can click on to include it as prompt context (before it was auto-included)
    - If a Page and floating thread are open simultaneously, the Page will show as **a suggested pill** that you can click on to include it as prompt context
  - Update: Bezi asks clarifying questions more frequently

  **General health:**

  - Improved agent mode's viewing of large files
  - Account Settings UI now opens in a popup to not disrupt the pages and threads workflows
  - Optimized context for @ mentioned assets and pages
  - Optimized context for viewing and searching GameObjects

<Update label="09/30/2025" description>
  ****************************_When you use Bezi to help with game development, memory is crucial. You want it to remember the core premise of your game, a great implementation plan from another thread, or a mechanic’s original state to track changes._****************************

  _There is so much crucial information that, unless stated, is totally unknown to Bezi and Unity, or easily gets lost in the context an AI system works through._

  ********\_We’ve built \_********[**_Pages_**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders)**\_ so you have the power to inject and reinforce these key details without repeating yourself or copy/pasting. Save longer-form project information in Pages and tag them in threads/prompts when a given task builds on them.\_**

  **Now introducing...**

  - **Pages (in beta)**: Store important, larger-format game information that can be tagged in threads/prompts to get more consistent and precise output
    - Save implementation plans and for Bezi to execute on in Agent Mode
    - Store your GDD to reference when work needs to be tailored to your game’s concept, roadmap, etc.
    - Pages must be referenced in prompts with @ mention
    - Pages is in beta - please share all your feedback and requests!
    - Read the docs: https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders
    - Page examples: Yahor to post / Sarah to add
  - **BEZI WORKS IN PLAY MODE NOW**! You can submit prompts in Play Mode & get answers to your runtime questions
    - No docs, just start prompting!

  **Usability improvements:**

  - Fixed a challenging bug that users have surfaced multiple times, causing not all rejected changes would be practically rejected in the files
  - Improved Bezi's ability to correctly identify and inspect active scenes, when unloaded scenes are present
  - Improved Bezi's ability to inspect components and gather more precise details

  **General health:**

  - Fixed the issue that blocked Enhanced Code Intelligence (ECI) from initializing on Mac
  - Fixed the conflict Bezi was having with some other apps (e.g. Intel GPU monitor, etc.)
</Update>

<Update label="09/23/2025" description>
  **Usability improvements:**

  - Bezi can now correctly display hierarchies of additively loaded scenes
  - Bezi can now find objects in much larger hierarchies

  **General health:**

  - Fixed a bug that was contributing to Bezi losing it's connection with Unity after an update
    - **PLEASE NOTE**: this fix will help in future updates - meaning this still may happen in today's update. If it does, you can resolve it by restarting your machine to clean up all Bezi processes and ports
  - Minor visual updates to templates UI
</Update>

<Update label="09/16/2025" description>
  **Usability improvements:**

  - Messages are no longer cancelled by a domain reload or Play Mode. Bezi will continue the response after the domain reload is complete

</Update>

<Update label="08/20/2025" description>
  > We want your feedback! We're committed to making Bezi as lightweight as possible and to not impact game developer's workflows or testing performance. \
  > After this update, do you notice any performance difference in your project's compile times, time to enter play mode, or general performance inside of Unity? If you do, can you share the before + after?

  **Usability improvements:**

  - Bezi \<\> Unity connection: improve reliability of the connection and shows clearer warning if a response cant be submitted / continue because Unity has become disconnected (usually due to a domain reload or being in Play Mode)
  - Agent Mode - Restore Checkpoint: now easier to restore checkpoints to any point in a thread, changes made in Agent Mode will be correctly restored, UI will accurately reflect which messages have been reverted, files created during the time can be removed, and more
  - Enhanced Code Intelligence (ECI): reducing the "Inactive" status many of you have reported by improving ECI's project auto-connect (Bezi now generates a .NET solution file for your Unity project using robust, built-in Unity methods)
  - Long threads performance: faster rendering for threads with lots of code edits

  **General health:**

  - Project sync performance: increased Bezi's servers abilities to adapt to traffic changes and efficiently index project assets
  - More bug fixes and polish!

</Update>

<Update label="07/29/2025" description>
  **Now introducing...**

  - Project Rules! Define project-wide rules for Bezi to follow. Set the code syntax, how to navigate your project's files, game design patterns, and other project-specific context, instructions, etc. you want Bezi to follow
    - Read the docs: https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/project-rules
  - Enhanced Code Intelligence: Turn this on to enable Bezi to find errors and warnings in your codebase on its own! Bezi hooks into the OmniSharp language server to catch errors in the code it writes or help you fix existing errors in your own code

<Update label="03/13/2025">
  **Bezi product update - moving into beta!**

  Excited to share that Bezi is moving into beta! The beta phase is focused on deep context of your Unity project. Using this context, Bezi can be queried to identify and propose fixes for console errors, answer questions about project contents and packages, and even teach you how to implement unfamiliar mechanics.

  During our alpha, we learned a lot from testers (you!) about what’s needed in order to reduce the noise and repeatable work in game development. This helped us prioritize the right things to build in our beta - and it all starts with strong context of your project.

  Heading into our beta (which starts today!) we invested a lot of effort into making sure Bezi has this complete context of your project. This context is the first step and we will add more capabilities powered by the context.

  We’ve learned that, above all, game dev tools need to be accurate and reliable in order to make the workflow more efficient. We hold Bezi to a high standard for both and will only ship new capabilities that meet this bar. During alpha it was clear there were issues with the script attaching and action creation capabilities. As a result, **script attaching and action creation will be temporarily disabled in Bezi**. They'll be re-implemented as soon as they are reliable and accurate enough to support game development!
