<Update label="03/13/2025">
  **Bezi product update - moving into beta\!**

  Excited to share that Bezi is moving into beta\! The beta phase is focused on deep context of your Unity project. Using this context, Bezi can be queried to identify and propose fixes for console errors, answer questions about project contents and packages, and even teach you how to implement unfamiliar mechanics.

  During our alpha, we learned a lot from testers (you\!) about what’s needed in order to reduce the noise and repeatable work in game development. This helped us prioritize the right things to build in our beta - and it all starts with strong context of your project.

  Heading into our beta (which starts today\!) we invested a lot of effort into making sure Bezi has this complete context of your project. This context is the first step and we will add more capabilities powered by the context.

  We’ve learned that, above all, game dev tools need to be accurate and reliable in order to make the workflow more efficient. We hold Bezi to a high standard for both and will only ship new capabilities that meet this bar. During alpha it was clear there were issues with the script attaching and action creation capabilities. As a result, **script attaching and action creation will be temporarily disabled in Bezi**. They'll be re-implemented as soon as they are reliable and accurate enough to support game development\!
