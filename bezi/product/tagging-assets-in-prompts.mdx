description: "Search and tag assets in a prompt to focus Bezi and get more the best response faster"

Tagging assets in a prompt ensures that important context doesn’t get missed\! It's not required but, if you _know_ something is essential, tagging it will ensure that Bezi focuses on and refrerences it in a response. This is especially helpful in larger projects with tens of thousands to millions of assets.

You can reference specific assets in your Unity project by name, using the @ symbol (scripts, models, packages, etc.) in your prompt.

- You can use the @ symbol to reference assets in-line in the input area. Type in 3 or more characters to trigger the search, and it will automatically filter to show a list of relevant suggestions based on your input.
- You can also reference assets by clicking on the ‘@’ icon button right above the input field. This will open up a popup menu with a search field.
- If you have any assets selected in your Unity project, those will be shown as ‘pills’ with a dotted line to indicate that those are selected, but not ‘pinned’ as references in the prompt yet. You can click on those to add them as references.
- Clicking on any ‘pills’ once more will remove them from the reference list.
