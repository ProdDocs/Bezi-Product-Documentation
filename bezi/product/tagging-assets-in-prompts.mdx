Tagging assets in a prompt ensures that important context doesn’t get missed\! Bezi does its best to gather the right info, but if you **_know_** something is essential, the only way to be 100% sure it’s accounted for is to mandate that with pinning. This is especially helpful in larger projects with tens of thousands to millions of assets.
