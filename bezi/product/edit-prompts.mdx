Dynamic prompting is designed to let you alter prompts after they're made, as you observe how Bezi responds to a prompt or realize critical information was left out. 

<Info>
  **Please note:** editing a past prompt within a task thread will regenerate the prompt you edited and erase all responses under it 
</Info>

To edit a past prompt, hover over the prompt and click the  <Icon icon="file-pen" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#000000" /> icon that appears in the upper right corner. This will activate edit mode for the existing prompt so you can edit, then resubmit it.
