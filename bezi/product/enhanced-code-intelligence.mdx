## What is enhanced code intelligence?

Enhanced code intelligence provides advanced IDE-like features for your Unity projects in Bezi. These currently include improved refactoring and compilation error self-healing. This guide covers the prerequisites and setup required to enable enhanced code intelligence.

## Prerequisites

To enable enhanced code intelligence, your project must meet two core requirements:

### 1) Project naming convention

Your Unity project name must match its corresponding `.sln` file:

- The `.sln` file must be located at the project root (adjacent to the `Assets` folder)
- The filename must exactly match your project name

**Example:**

```
My-Unity-Project/
├── Assets/
├── Library/
├── ProjectSettings/
└── My-Unity-Project.sln ← Must match project name
```

### 2) .NET SDK installation

You must have the .NET SDK installed globally on your system. This lets Bezi develop a deeper understanding of the code.

**Default installation locations:**

- macOS (Intel): `/usr/local/share/dotnet/x64/dotnet`
- macOS (Apple Silicon): `/usr/local/share/dotnet`
- Windows: `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\dotnet`

**Setup steps:**

1. Download and install the appropriate .NET SDK for your Unity version
   - For Unity-specific .NET requirements, see [Unity's .NET Profile Support documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/dotnetProfileSupport.html)
2. Close out of, then relaunch the Bezi app
3. Navigate to the bottom right, the enhanced code intelligence UI should be set to active
