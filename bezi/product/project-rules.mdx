## What are Project Rules?

Project Rules are persistent, reusable context that Bezi applies to every prompt response in a project. Adding Project Rules is the best way to ensure Bezi’s assistance will be consistent with your project’s goals, preferences, and workflows.

<Note>
  **Project Rules only apply to the Unity project they’re set in**. To apply the same Project Rules across multiple projects, finalize them in one project, then paste them into the other Project Rules pages.
</Note>

Use Project Rules for:

1. **Output and structural guidelines**: define code syntax, input/UI systems, debug strategies, domain-specific knowledge, project-specific workflows, and more
2. **Communication preferences**: set Bezi’s tone of voice, your proficiency level, how much instruction you want, and more

## How do I access Project Rules?

To access your Project Rules, click the  <Icon icon="sidebar" iconType="regular" color="#000000" />  icon in the top left of your app to open the Sidebar. Within the Sidebar, select `Project Rules` to open the page.

Upon opening the Project Rules page, you'll see some default rules. You can choose to iterate on them or delete them and write your own.

## Writing guide and examples

See the **Project Rule examples below** for best practices. Project Rules can be written in natural languange. Like a prompt, an effective Project Rule is focused on a specific purpose. Do not try to pack too much into a single rule.

**Rules must be**: clear, direct, easy to understand, applicable to the entire project

**Rules cannot**: contradict each other, be conditional (_if_..., _otherwise_...)

### Rule examples: Communication preferences

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customize Bezi’s personality and responses">
    - _Make your tone less “eager-to-please”. All responses should be blunt and concise, yet friendly._
    - _Refer to me only as “buddy” in all responses moving forward._
    - _At the end of each message, add a motivational quote._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match Bezi's response style and depth to your experience level">
    - _I've been creating games as a hobby and want to learn professional game programming. Explain all software development and Unity-specific terms and concepts in detail. Include relevant project examples in your explanations as often as possible._
    - _You are a professional Senior Unity Gameplay Developer. Don’t explain basic things._
    - _I am a Game Designer looking to brainstorm new ideas. As we converse, don’t hesitate to suggest ideas for my game\!_

### Rule examples: Output and structural guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set code guidelines and logic">
    _Before you propose code-related changes, review all relevant scripts and analyze their code styles._

    _Make sure all code-related changes you propose, to new or existing scripts, follow the project’s standard coding guidelines:_

    1. _Use camel case for naming_
    2. _Prefer long self-explanatory names for variables, methods, and types_
    3. _Add short summary comments for all methods only and for each step in complex algorithms_
    4. _Split long code statements into smaller ones_
    5. _Use constant fields instead of in-place constants_
    6. _Add logs for better debugging but avoid logs in extensively used methods (like Update)_
    7. _Avoid combining unrelated responsibilities in a single script. Follow SOLID principles_

    _This is an example of code that follows the project’s standard coding guidelines:_

    ```c#
    using UnityEngine;
    
    /// <summary> Helps with Raycasting </summary>
    public class PhysicsHelper : MonoBehaviour
    {
    		private LayerMask layerMask = LayerMask.GetMask("Wall", "Character");
    	
    		// See Order of Execution for Event Functions for information on FixedUpdate() and Update() related to physics queries
    		private void FixedUpdate()
    		{
    			RaycastHit hit;
    			// Does the ray intersect any objects excluding the player layer
    			// TODO: Remove spammy logs after debugging
    			if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward), out hit, Mathf.Infinity, layerMask))
    			{
    			    Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward) * hit.distance, Color.yellow);
    					Debug.Log("Did Hit");
    			}
    			else
    			{
    					Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward) * 1000, Color.white);
    					Debug.Log("Did not Hit");
    			}
    		}
    }
    ```

  <Accordion title="Encode system preferences and project-specific knowledge ">
    - _I develop a 2D game. Unity is configured for 2D development using sprites and an orthographic camera. Make sure to follow Unity’s best practices for 2D games._
    - _My project should use the old Unity Input System and old UGUI for interfaces; never suggest newer solutions. Always use Sprite Atlases._
    - _My project uses:_
      1. _Unity 6000.0 (aka Unity 6)_
      2. _new Input System for handling player’s input_
      3. _new UI Toolkit for user interfaces_
      4. `com.unity.mobile.notifications@2.4.1`_package for local notifications_

  <Accordion title="Explain the game’s concept and goals">
    _My Game is an arcade-style side-scroller inspired by Flappy Bird, where players pilot a futuristic hovercraft through a dynamic, procedurally generated gauntlet of moving obstacles, shifting gravity zones, and collectible power-ups. Unlike the original, players can tap to boost upward or swipe to trigger special maneuvers like dashes or time-slow. The goal is to survive as long as possible, unlock new vehicles, and master increasingly chaotic levels while competing on global leaderboards._

  <Accordion title="Define response steps and workflow requirements ">
    - _When I ask you to suggest ideas, always check the web for relevant materials. Only suggest the latest, most popular, and proven solutions._
    - [___When I ask you to debug something, always check http://stackoverflow.com for common solutions and known issues.___](http://stackoverflow.com)
    - _When you generate scripts, give me clear and concise instructions on how to use them, which GameObjects to attach them to, and how to properly set them up._
    - _When you are unsure how to fix an issue, suggest adding logs for tracing a bug._
