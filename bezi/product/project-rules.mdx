## What are Project Rules?

Project Rules provide persistent, reusable context that Bezi applies to every prompt in the project. Project Rules are referenced in every prompt response, so the AI assistance adheres to your defined project goals, preferences, and workflows.

<Note>
  **Project Rules only apply to the Unity project they’re set in**. To apply the same Project Rules across multiple projects, finalize them in one project, then paste them into the other Project Rules pages.
