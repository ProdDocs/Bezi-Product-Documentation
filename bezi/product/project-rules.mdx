## What are Project Rules?

Persistent, reusable context that Bezi will apply to every prompt response in the project. Adding Project Rules is the best way to ensure Bezi’s assistance will be consistent with your project’s goals, preferences, and workflows.

<Note>
  **Project Rules only apply to the Unity project they’re set in**. To apply the same Project Rules across multiple projects, finalize them in one project, then paste them into the other Project Rules pages.
</Note>

### **What to use Project Rules for:**

1. **Output and structural guidelines**: define code syntax, input/UI systems, debug strategies, domain-specific knowledge, project-specific workflows, and more
2. **Communication preferences**: set Bezi’s tone of voice, your proficiency level, how much instruction you want, and more

### **How to access Project Rules:**

To access your Project Rules, click the  <Icon icon="sidebar" iconType="regular" color="#000000" />  icon in the top left of your app to open the Sidebar then select `Project Rules` to open the page.

Project Rules comes with default rules. You can edit those or write your own from scratch.

## Project Rules writing guide

**See the Project Rules examples (below) for best practice**s. Project Rules can be written in natural languange. Like a prompt, an effective Project Rule is focused on a specific purpose. Do not try to pack too much into a single rule.

**Rules must be**: clear, direct, easy to understand, applicable to the entire project

**Rules should not**: contradict each other, be conditional (_if_..., _otherwise_...)

## Project Rules examples

### Rule examples: Communication preferences

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customize Bezi’s personality and responses">
    - _Make your tone less “eager-to-please”. All responses should be blunt and concise, yet friendly._
    - _Refer to me only as “buddy” in all responses moving forward._
    - _At the end of each message, add a motivational quote._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match Bezi's response style and depth to your experience level">
    - _I've been creating games as a hobby and want to learn professional game programming. Explain all software development and Unity-specific terms and concepts in detail. Include relevant project examples in your explanations as often as possible._
    - _You are a professional Senior Unity Gameplay Developer. Don’t explain basic things._
    - _I am a Game Designer looking to brainstorm new ideas. As we converse, don’t hesitate to suggest ideas for my game\!_
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Rule examples: Output and structural guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set code guidelines and logic">
    _Before you propose code-related changes, review all relevant scripts and analyze their code styles._

    _Make sure all code-related changes you propose, to new or existing scripts, follow the project’s standard coding guidelines:_

    1. _Use camel case for naming_
    2. _Prefer long self-explanatory names for variables, methods, and types_
    3. _Add short summary comments for all methods only and for each step in complex algorithms_
    4. _Split long code statements into smaller ones_
    5. _Use constant fields instead of in-place constants_
    6. _Add logs for better debugging but avoid logs in extensively used methods (like Update)_

    _This is an example of code that follows the project’s standard coding guidelines:_

    ```c#
    using UnityEngine;
    
    /// <summary> Helps with Raycasting </summary>
    public class PhysicsHelper : MonoBehaviour
    {
    		private LayerMask layerMask = LayerMask.GetMask("Wall", "Character");
    	
    		// See Order of Execution for Event Functions for information on FixedUpdate() and Update() related to physics queries
    		private void FixedUpdate()
    		{
    			RaycastHit hit;
    			// Does the ray intersect any objects excluding the player layer
    			// TODO: Remove spammy logs after debugging
    			if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward), out hit, Mathf.Infinity, layerMask))
    			{
    			    Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward) * hit.distance, Color.yellow);
    					Debug.Log("Did Hit");
    			}
    			else
    			{
    					Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward) * 1000, Color.white);
    					Debug.Log("Did not Hit");
    			}
    		}
    }
    ```

  <Accordion title="Encode system preferences and project-specific knowledge ">
    - _I'm developing a 2D game. Unity is configured for 2D development using sprites and an orthographic camera. Make sure to follow Unity’s best practices for 2D games._
    - _My project should use the old Unity Input System and old UGUI for interfaces; never suggest newer solutions. Always use Sprite Atlases._
    - _My project uses:_
      1. _Unity 6000.0 (aka Unity 6)_
      2. _new Input System for handling player’s input_
      3. _new UI Toolkit for user interfaces_
      4. `com.unity.mobile.notifications@2.4.1`_package for local notifications_
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define how you want Bezi to approach debugging">
    _When I tell you that your solution does not work, provide additional, detailed debugging and troubleshooting steps based on best programming practices, so I can execute them, copy and paste the logs back to you, so you can identify the real cause of the issue and explain it to me. _
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define response steps and workflow requirements ">
    - _When I ask you to suggest ideas, always check the web for relevant materials. Only suggest the latest, most popular, and proven solutions._
    - [**_When I ask you to debug something, always check http://stackoverflow.com for common solutions and known issues._**](http://stackoverflow.com)
    - _When you generate scripts, give me clear and concise instructions on how to use them, which GameObjects to attach them to, and how to properly set them up._
    - _When you are unsure how to fix an issue, suggest adding logs for tracing a bug._
