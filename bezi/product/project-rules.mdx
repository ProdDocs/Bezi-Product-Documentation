## What are Project Rules?

Project Rules are persistent, reusable context that Bezi applies to every prompt response in a project. Adding Project Rules is the best way to ensure Bezi’s assistance will be consistent with your project’s goals, preferences, and workflows.

<Note>
  **Project Rules only apply to the Unity project they’re set in**. To apply the same Project Rules across multiple projects, finalize them in one project, then paste them into the other Project Rules pages.
</Note>

Use Project Rules for:

1. **Output and structural guidelines**: define code syntax, input/UI systems, debug strategies, domain-specific knowledge, project-specific workflows, and more
2. **Communication preferences**: set Bezi’s tone of voice, your proficiency level, how much instruction you want, and more

## How do I access Project Rules?

To access your Project Rules, click the  <Icon icon="sidebar" iconType="regular" color="#000000" />  icon in the top left of your app to open the Sidebar. Within the Sidebar, select `Project Rules` to open the page.

Upon opening the Project Rules page, you'll see some default rules. You can choose to iterate on them or delete them and write your own.

## Writing guide and examples

Project Rules can be written in natural languange. Like a prompt, an effective Project Rule is focused on a specific purpose. Do not try to pack too much into a single rule.

**Rules must be**: clear, direct, easy to understand, applicable to the entire project

**Rules cannot**: contradict each other, be conditional (_if_..., _otherwise_...)

    - _Make your tone less “eager-to-please”. All responses should be blunt and concise, yet friendly._
    - _Refer to me only as “buddy” in all responses moving forward._
    - _At the end of each message, add a motivational quote._
