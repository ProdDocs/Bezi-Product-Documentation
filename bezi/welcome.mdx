title: "Welcome to Bezi"

Bezi is a game development assistant with full context of your Unity project. You can prompt it to debug errors, write scripts in your coding style, answer questions about the project (scripts, assets, docs), or get step-by-step instructions to build a new mechanic.

Bezi is an independent desktop app that connects to a Unity project. This enables Bezi to return responses that are specific to your project context and keep all your work within Unity.

Please post any issues or questions in our [**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9). We’ll reply as fast as possible. We many need to ask you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.
