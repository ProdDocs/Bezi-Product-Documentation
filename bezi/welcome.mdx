Bezi is a game development assistant that understands your Unity project. You can prompt it to debug errors, write and implement scripts in your coding style, answer questions about the project (scripts, assets, docs), or get step-by-step instructions to build a new mechanic.

Bezi is an independent application that connects to your Unity project. This enables Bezi to index your project and the existing context to return responses that are specific to your project.

Please post any issues or questions in our [**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9). We’ll reply as fast as possible. We many need to ask you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.

## How Bezi understands your project

Bezi indexes a Unity project (assets, code & scripts, packages, and more) to gather complete context of it. All responses are then adapted based on that context.

Do not use Bezi until asset sync is successfully completed for the project. If asset sync isn't completed, Bezi won’t have context of your project which may lead to it responding with generic answers.

See the Asset Sync product docs for complete details.
