Bezi is a game dev tool with complete context of your Unity project. It indexes a Unity project in real-time, registering the **assets, scenes, packages, codebase and more.** AI is used to apply all the context and memory to blockers and tasks that impede your workflow.

We’ve invested in a top-tier IP security programme so your project data is never at risk of being mishandled or exposed. Among other things, **no project data is ever used to train models**. We encourage you to review our [security programme and FAQs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/security). For any security-related questions, email [security@bezi.com](mailto:security@bezi.com).

Below are some popular ways studios use Bezi. Give it a spin and share your thoughts on our [**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9)!

## How Bezi understands your project

Bezi indexes a Unity project (assets, scripts, packages, and more) to gather complete context of it. All responses are customized according to this context.

Do not use Bezi until asset sync is successfully completed for the project. If it isn't completed, Bezi will have incomplete project context, which may cause generic or incomplete responses.
