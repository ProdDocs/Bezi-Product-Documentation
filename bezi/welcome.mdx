Bezi is a game dev tool with complete context of your Unity project. It indexes a Unity project in-real time, registering all the **assets, scenes, packages, codebase and more.** It uses LLMs to find and apply task-relevant context, so every response is specific to the work at hand.

Because Bezi connects to the project, we invest heavily in IP security to keep your project data safe. **<u>No project data is ever used to train models</u>**. We encourage you to review our security program and [security FAQs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/security). For security-related questions, email [security@bezi.com](mailto:security@bezi.com).

Studios and indie devs use Bezi to be more efficient, without compromising IP security. Give it a try and share your thoughts on [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9)!

# **How to use Bezi**

<Note>
  Bezi’s UI is very simple **_because_** the power lies in prompting. This **<u>feels</u>** intuitive but, just like any other tool, time gets wasted if we don't learn the fundamentals before diving in.
</Note>

## How to prompt

1. **Best prompt structure:** Current state, Expected/Ideal state, Response format you want
   1. Prototype example: “_I have a system for X. I want to adjust it to add Y. Prototype that and describe any necessary setup steps_.”
1. Prompt quality = response quality
   1. DO NOT prompt "_fix_ _errors":_ This will get get a bad response. Bezi doesn’t know which error you want fixed.
1. Bezi cannot read minds; the more relevant info, the better! These tools help give it specifics:
   1. Always [**pin relevant project assets, scripts, etc. in-line**:](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/prompt-tagging) type “@” to search or select an asset/gameObject in Unity
   2. Use [**image attachments**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/attach-images) (screenshots, figma layouts, etc.)
1. **If Bezi gives a response you don’t like, DO NOT PROMPT TO FIX IT.** This causes rabbit-holes. Instead:
   1. Edit the original prompt & add extra info that the old reply missed. This regenerates the response (and wipes any changes that followed the OG).
   2. OR Start a new thread, summarize what you you liked from the previous, and re-ask the question
1. More Do's and Don'ts of prompting: https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/prompt-guide

## How to use threads

1. Threads are a series of prompts/responses
2. Keep threads short: aim for \<10 prompts per thread
3. **Only 1** topic/task per thread: start a new thread when the topic or task changes!
4. Bezi uses an active thread’s history as context for prompt responses in the thread. Threads that are long or cover multiple tasks/topics create noise and will lead to a worse response

## When to use Ask vs Agent Mode

- Use [**Ask Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/ask-mode) when you want Bezi to ideate, plan, search for information, etc.
- ONLY use [**Agent Mode**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode) when you want Bezi to write/modify scripts
