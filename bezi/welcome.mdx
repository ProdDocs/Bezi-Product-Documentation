title: "Welcome to Bezi"

Bezi is a game dev tool with complete context of your Unity project. It indexes a Unity project in-real time, registering all the **assets, scenes, packages, codebase and more.** It uses LLMs to find and apply task-relevant context, so every response is specific to the work at hand.

Because Bezi connects to the Unity project, one of our core tenets is IP security. We invest heavily in making sure project data is kept safe and private. **<u>No project data is ever used to train models</u>**. We encourage you to review our security programme and [security FAQs](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/security). For security-related questions, email [security@bezi.com](mailto:security@bezi.com).

Studios and indie devs use Bezi to be more efficient, without compromising IP security. Give it a shot and let us know what you think on our [**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9)!

## How Bezi understands your project

Bezi indexes a Unity project (assets, scripts, packages, and more) to gather complete context of it. All responses are customized according to this context.

Do not use Bezi until asset sync is successfully completed for the project. If it isn't completed, Bezi will have incomplete project context, which may cause generic or incomplete responses.
