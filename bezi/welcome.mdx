title: "Welcome to Bezi"

Bezi is a game development assistant with full context of your Unity project. You can prompt it to debug errors, write scripts in your coding style, answer questions about the project (scripts, assets, docs), or get step-by-step instructions to build a new mechanic.

Bezi is an independent desktop app that connects to a Unity project. This enables Bezi to return responses that are specific to your project context and keep all your work within Unity.

Please post any issues or questions in our [**Discord server**](https://discord.com/invite/UKWB46HTT9). We’ll reply as fast as possible. We many need to ask you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.

## Unity versions that support Bezi

- Best: **Unity 2022 LTS** (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)
- Supported: **2021 LTS**
- Supported: **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1** (in active development by Unity, which can impact it's ability to support external apps and means Bezi may not always have the most up-to-date information on recent changes to terminology, etc.)

## How Bezi understands your project

Bezi uses a process we call “Asset Sync” to learn about a Unity project. It reviews assets, codebase & scripts, packages, and more. All responses are then adapted based on that context.

Do not use Bezi until Asset Sync is completed for a given project. If Asset Sync isn't completed, Bezi won’t have context of your project which may lead to it responding with generic answers.

See the Asset Sync documentation for complete details.
