title: "Project Indexing"
---

The first time you connect Bezi to a Unity project, it will index the entire project. Larger projects take more time to index.

<Warning>
  Do not prompt Bezi until asset sync is completed. Until your project is fully indexed, Bezi won't have complete context and you may get generic responses.
</Warning>

Bezi only needs to index the entire project once. After that, Bezi automatically tracks updates in the project and updates its context in real-time.

## What Bezi can and cannot know about a project

**It's important to know this, as it informs what Bezi is best-suited to help with**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What Bezi can index / know">
    **/Assets**

    - Scripts (Monobehaviours, Scriptable Objects)
    - Materials, Models, InputActions, Render Pipelines, etc. 
    - Scenes, Prefabs (in Edit AND Play Mode)
      - Hierarchy
      - Components, Variables

    **/Packages**

    - All Unity packages
    - External packages and folders can be enabled on request

    **In-Bezi context**

    - Rules
    - Pages
    - Pins
    - History of the active thread

    **Any searchable information on the web**

    - Unity docs
    - Stack Overflow, etc.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What Bezi cannot index / know">
    **Visual layouts**

    - e.g. UI visuals, visual behavior in scene
    - Bezi can only understand visual via data - there isn't a constant camera running in your scene, so it cannot see or understand visuals like a human can
    - Use Image attachments whenever you want Bezi to "see" something - best workaround for now!

    **Git diffs**

    - “What was in that last push?”
    - Bezi knows the present state of a project, but cannot track / compare to past versions

    **Node-based stuff (Animators, Shadergraphs, etc.)**

    - Some understanding, but can’t create or modify it
    - Parameters yes; layout, iffy
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Indexing process

Track the project's index status in the **Asset sync panel**. The panel is located in the bottom right toolbar.

Before opening the asset sync panel, confirm Bezi and the Unity project are connected.

### Sync in-progress

When indexing is in progress, you’ll see a list of project assets, packages, etc. in the queue. Status icons update in real-time so you can track progress.

<Accordion title="Asset sync panel icons" defaultOpen>
  There are a few different icons you'll see in the Asset Sync queue that indicate an asset's indexing status.

  - <Icon icon="loader" iconType="sharp-solid" /> -  asset is in the process of indexing
  - <Icon icon="circle-0" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#0bf139" /> -  asset has been successfully indexed
  - <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#fcd415" /> -  asset is taking a long time to sync, click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to restart the sync for it
  - <Icon icon="circle-0" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#f10909" /> -  asset was not indexed (see the Error tab)
</Accordion>

### Sync completed

When Asset sync has indexed everything, the panel will say “_asset sync queue is empty_”. 

To confirm the project is successfully synced, open the **Error tab** in the Asset sync panel. If there are no errors, you're ready to prompt Bezi!

## What if there are issues indexing my project?

1. Review the errors in the Asset sync panel's **Error tab**
2. Return to the Asset sync panel
3. Click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to force an update

If the errors persist, take the following steps to resolve possible project-level issues. If Step 1 resolves the errors, do not proceed to Step 2.

1. Quit the Bezi app, reopen it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel
2. Uninstall Bezi's Unity plugin, reinstall it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel

If the Errors tab still shows error(s), take a screenshot of the Unity console log errors and email it to us at [**support@bezi.com**](mailto:support@bezi.com) so we can help resolve it.
