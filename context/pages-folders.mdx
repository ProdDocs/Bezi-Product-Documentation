## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store important game information that doesn't live in Unity, such as feature specs, UI guidelines, and GDDs. 

**Once stored in Bezi, you can easily reference Page information while prompting to ensure Bezi has all the context it needs with no repetitive effort on your part.**

The interface is a text editor. Each Page has a 10,000 character limit. Pages can be created and modified in two ways: 

1. By you, directly creating/editing/deleting a Page
2. By prompting Bezi, which can create or edit on your behalf 

## When to use Pages

If there's information relevant to your game or workflow that doesn't live in Unity and will be important for Bezi to reference, document it in a Page. 

game information that doesn't live in Unity, such as feature specs, development guidelines, and broader narratives. 

### **Guidelines and plans to execute against**

Document the information in a Page, write a prompt in Agent Mode, pin the Page (@PageName), and tell Bezi to execute on the plan.

- UI creation guidelines
- Level creation guidelines
- Feature implementation plans

### Systems and architecture patterns to follow

- Core game mechanics (e.g., “Jumping uses stamina”)
- Explaining how a system works

### **Game-level information to inform strategy work**

Store meta-level game information, like GDDs or system architecture. Pin the Page in any prompts that require keeping the game’s end-state in mind. **Pin the Page in prompts that reference existing goals or patterns**

- Define key game strategy or plans, using Bezi to identify possible gaps
- Set pre-established game directions or patterns you want Bezi to follow across threads
