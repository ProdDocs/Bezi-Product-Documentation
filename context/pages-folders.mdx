## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store important game information that doesn't live in Unity, such as feature specs, UI guidelines, and GDDs.

**Once stored in Bezi, you can easily reference Page information while prompting to ensure Bezi has all the context it needs with no repetitive effort on your part.**

The interface is a text editor. Each Page has a 10,000 character limit. Pages can be created and modified in two ways:

1. By you, directly creating/editing/deleting a Page
2. By prompting Bezi, which can create or edit on your behalf

## When to use Pages

If there's information relevant to your game or workflow that doesn't live in Unity and will be important for Bezi to reference, document it in a Page.

### **Guidelines and plans to execute against**

Write a prompt in Agent Mode, pin the Page (@PageName), and tell Bezi to execute on the plan.

- UI creation guidelines
- Level creation guidelines
- Feature implementation plans

### Systems and architecture patterns to follow

Pin the Page (@PageName) whenever you need Bezi to reference the existing pattern. 

- Core game mechanics (e.g., “Jumping uses stamina”)
- Explaining how a specific system works 

### **Game-level information to inform strategy work**

Store meta-level game information, like GDDs. Pin the Page (@PageName) in higher-level tasks that need to anchor on a feature's goal or the game's end-state.

- Key game strategy or plans
- Pre-established game directions that need to be followed across threads

## [​](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders#what-are-folders)What are folders?

Pages are organized into folders. To manage a folder or the Pages in it, hover over the Folder and click the`…`icon. You will see a menu of options to:

- Rename the folder
- Move Pages in/out of the folder
- Delete the folder

<Danger>
  **Deleting a folder will delete all Pages in it**. Do not delete any folders until you’ve confirmed all Pages have been moved.
