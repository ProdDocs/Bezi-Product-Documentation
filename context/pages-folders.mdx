## What are Pages?

Pages are where you store important game information that doesn't live in Unity, so Bezi. Bezi can use this information to make responses more consistent and specific to your game’s goals.

Pages' interface is a text editor. Each Page has a 10,000 character limit. Pages can be created and modified directly (by you) or through prompting (by Bezi). Only you can edit or modify Page content - Bezi cannot be prompted to do this on your behalf yet.
