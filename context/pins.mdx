description: "Pin must-have context in a prompt to improve the speed and accuracy of Bezi’s response"
---

Pin relevant information (assets, scripts, Pages, etc) in prompts to focus Bezi in , so Bezi can generate the best response faster. If you _know_ something is essential, pin it. This is extra important in large projects with thousands to millions of assets, scripts, etc.

## **Pinning best practices**

1. Pin as much as possible. It will only improve the quality and speed of Bezi's responses.
2. Confirm all active, persistant pins (solid/white, above the prompt input field) are relevant to a prompt before submitting. Irrelevant pins will send Bezi looking in the wrong direction.

## **What can be pinned in a prompt?**

Any context Bezi gathers can be referenced in a prompt. This includes:

- In-Unity context: Scripts, assets, packages, etc.
- In-Bezi context: Pages

## **How to pin in a prompt**

### **Type @ while writing prompt, then the name of what you want to pin**

To in-line pin while writing your prompt, type @ then 3+ characters to trigger the search pop-up. The search popup will filter options based on the characters you type.

### **Click the @ icon above the prompt input field**

You can find and add pins by clicking on the`@`icon above the prompt input field. This will open up a popup menu to search in.

## **Pills: context based pin suggestions**

If you select something in your Unity project, Bezi will surface it as a **pill** (suggested pin) above the prompt input field. **You must click the pill to transform it into a pin**.

## **Disabling irrelevant pins**

Always review your pins and disable irrelevant ones before submitting a prompt.

1. Review all the active pins above the prompt input field
2. Click the ones you wish to remove
3. Confirm the irrelevant pins are gone or returned to pill state (greyed out, dotted border)
