Bezi cannot _see_ something the way a human can. It uses on project data to piece together how things look, which leaves gaps for visual-heavy work.

Image attachments are the only way that Bezi can "see" visual context or direction. They're a great way to close Bezi's visual gap, provide reference points for visual work, or quickly give Bezi more information on the parts of Unity we have limited access to.

- **Create UI or levels**: Give visual references that Bezi can copy
- **Debug visual issues**: Give visual documentation of the issue(s), explain what's wrong and how it differs from the expected state
- **Fix Console, Unity Inspector, Unity’s Player Settings & Preferences errors**: Bezi has limited visibility into these in Unity, so screenshots are a fast way to give Bezi all the necessary info
- **Ask Unity Profiler and optimization questions**: Bezi has limited visibility into these in Unity, so screenshots are a fast way to give Bezi all the necessary info

## Using image attachments

If your prompt includes image attachments, it ALSO needs specific instructions on the following:

1. What parts of the image(s) Bezi should focus on
2. What information Bezi should gather or look for
3. What Bezi needs do with the information

You can attach up to 3 images per prompt, which is great if you need Bezi to compare / contrast images.

## How to upload

**There are two ways to attach an image:**

1. Drag/drop it into the prompt box
2. Click the attachment icon in the prompt box and select the file

**Upload specs: **

- Max file size: **5 MB** and **8000x8000 px**.
- Supported image file formats: **JPEG**, **PNG**, **WebP**, and **GIF**.
  - Since GIFs are a collection of images, Bezi can only analyze the first frame.
- You can attach multiple images (up to 3) per prompt
