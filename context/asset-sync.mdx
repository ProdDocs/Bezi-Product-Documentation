description: "How Bezi indexes your project  "

Asset sync enables Bezi to understand your Unity project and craft accurate, helpful responses.

Do not prompt Bezi until asset sync is successfully completed. If your project hasn't been indexed, Bezi won't have complete context and you may get generic responses.

When connecting a Unity project to Bezi for the first time, Bezi will need time to index the project. Larger projects will need more time to index.

Once initial indexing is completed for a project, Bezi will automatically check for modifications to the project (while it's connected) and will update the context in real-time to keep responses relevant.

## **Where to track asset's sync status**

Track the project's asset sync status in the **Asset sync panel**. To open the Asset sync panel, click the icon in the bottom bar.

## **Tracking asset sync completion**

Before opening the Asset sync panel, confirm the Bezi app and the Unity project are connected.

### **When asset sync is in progress**

When asset sync is in progress, you’ll see a list of project assets to be indexed in the panel. Asset's status icons will update as they're indexed so you can track their progress in real time.

### **When assets are done syncing**

When Asset sync has indexed everything, the panel will say “_asset sync queue is empty_”.

However, **this does not mean all assets were successfully synced**.

### **When all assets are successfully synced**

To confirm all assets are successfully synced, check if the Asset Sync Error panel icon ( ) has a red dot in it. If there's no red dot, you're ready to prompt Bezi!

## **What if there are issues syncing my assets?**

If there are issues syncing assets, the **Asset sync errors panel** icon () will have a red dot in it. If this happens:

1. Open the Asset sync errors panel to see what the issue is
2. Return to the Asset sync panel
3. Click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to force an update

If the Asset sync errors persist, take the following steps to resolve possible project-level errors. If quitting the Bezi app resolves the errors, you do not need to uninstall the plugin.

1. Quit the Bezi app, reopen it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel
2. Uninstall the Bezi Unity plugin, reinstall it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel

If the Asset sync errors panel still shows error(s), take a screenshot of the Unity console log errors and email it to us at [**support@bezi.com**](mailto:support@bezi.com) so we can help resolve it.
