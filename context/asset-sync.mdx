description: "How Bezi indexes your project  "
---

Asset sync is how Bezi develops complete context of your project, in order to provide accurate, helpful responses.

<Warning>
  Do not prompt Bezi until asset sync is completed. Until your project is fully indexed, Bezi won't have complete context and you may get generic responses.
</Warning>

The first time you connect Bezi to a Unity project, it will index the entire project. Larger projects take more time to index.

Bezi only needs to index the entire project once. After that, Bezi automatically tracks updates in the project and updates its context in real-time.

## What Bezi can vs cannot know about a project

**It's important to know this, as it informs what Bezi is best-suited to help with**.

    - Materials, Models, InputActions, Render Pipelines, etc. 
    - Scenes, Prefabs (in Edit AND Play Mode)

      - Components, Variables

    - All
    - External packages and folders can be enabled on request

## **Where to track asset's sync status**

Track the project's sync status in the **Asset sync panel**. The panel is located in the bottom right toolbar.

## **Asset sync process**

Before opening the asset sync panel, confirm Bezi and the Unity project are connected.

When asset sync is in progress, you’ll see a list of project assets, packages, etc. in the index queue. Status icons update in real-time so you can track progress.

<Accordion title="Asset sync panel icons" defaultOpen>
  There are a few different icons you'll see in the Asset Sync queue that indicate an asset's indexing status.

  - <Icon icon="loader" iconType="sharp-solid" /> -  asset is in the process of indexing
  - <Icon icon="circle-0" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#0bf139" /> -  asset has been successfully indexed
  - <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#fcd415" /> -  asset is taking a long time to sync, click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to restart the sync for it
  - <Icon icon="circle-0" iconType="sharp-solid" color="#f10909" /> -  asset was not indexed (see Asset Sync issues section)
</Accordion>

### **Project is done syncing**

When Asset sync has indexed everything, the panel will say “_asset sync queue is empty_”.

However, **this does not mean the project was successfully synced**.

### **Project is successfully synced**

To confirm the project is successfully synced, open the **Error tab** in the Asset sync panel. If there are no errors, you're ready to prompt Bezi!

## **What if there are issues syncing my project?**

1. Review the errors in the Asset sync panel's **Error tab**
2. Return to the Asset sync panel
3. Click the `refresh` icon in the top right of the Asset sync panel to force an update

If the errors persist, take the following steps to resolve possible project-level issues. If Step 1 resolves the errors, do not proceed to Step 2.

1. Quit the Bezi app, reopen it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel
2. Uninstall Bezi's Unity plugin, reinstall it, and click the `refresh` icon in the Asset sync panel

If the Errors tab still shows error(s), take a screenshot of the Unity console log errors and email it to us at [**support@bezi.com**](mailto:support@bezi.com) so we can help resolve it.
