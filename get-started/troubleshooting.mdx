## How to report a bug or issue

If you run into something that isn’t addressed here or feels like a bug, please let us know so we can make it better:

## App Setup and Connecting Bezi to Your Unity Project

### What versions of Unity does Bezi support?

- **Unity 6**
- **Unity 2023**
- **Unity 2022**
- **Unity 2021**

### I see a popup that says _“Failed to install Unity Plugin”_  when I try connecting it with my Unity project. What do I do?

Occasionally this error shows if a Unity set-up isn’t conducive with the Bezi plugin. Please try these things (in order) to see if either resolve. If neither work, reach out to [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com) for assistance.

1. Follow the Bezi flow to install the Unity plugin with administrator priviledges
2. Download the Unity plugin directly from our [Changelog](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/changelog)

### I can no longer find my project in Bezi after installing a package, and when I add the project manually I get a pop up that says “Error adding project”. Why?

This error occurs when installing some template games for the Unity Asset Store. Doing so may overwrite the **productGUID** with an **invalid GUID** (00000000000000000000000000000000). Bezi requires a valid GUID to work, so this immediately breaks the connection to the project.

To fix the issue, you need to fix the project. We recommend trying these solutions, in order:

1. (If you have version control) Revert changes to ProjectSettings.asset and its .meta file
2. Close and reopen the Unity Project to regenerate the GUID
3. Delete the Library Folder to force-regenerate the GUID

<Note>
  Bezi keeps track of history using the GUID, so changing/regenerating the productGUID may lose your previous threads. In the future, we recommend **unchecking ProjectSettings.asset** in the Import pop-up, or copying the productGUID prior to install and replacing it after.
</Note>

### Why am I seeing a _"Consent Request"_ popup from Unity?

The popup is completely safe to accept and will only modify the scripts that make Bezi; none of your personal files will be affected.

We use some APIs in Bezi that can be auto-updated by Unity, but these may change between versions. This popup just updates them to use the latest for whatever version of Unity you’re working in.

### How do I know if Bezi is connected to my Unity project?

The connection indicators in your Unity project and Bezi app will both be green if they’re connected. If either are red, the connection is broken and the apps cannot communicate.

> If you've installed the plugin but Bezi and Unity aren't successfully connecting, see the question below about troubleshooting a failed or lost connection.
