We’re proud to serve everyone - from AAA studios to solo devs - and maintain an exceptionally high bar for security to meet your needs.

Our [Security Program](https://www.bezi.com/security) reviews the measures currently in practice. Custom, enhanced security programmes are available through our Enterprise plan.

For all security-related questions, please email [security@bezi.com](mailto:security@bezi.com).

### What project data does Bezi ingest?

After Bezi is connected to a Unity project, it will index the entire project. Project data refers to the scripts and assets that Bezi indexes during that process.

We only index the project data required to provide project-accurate responses.

### Is my project data used to train any of the LLM provider’s models?

Never. When an AI request is made, LLM providers will see project data needed to help generate a response or output to your prompt, but our licenses with these providers ensure that your data will not be used to train their models.

### How is project data stored by Bezi, for how long?

For optimal application performance, scripts and select assets are cached securely on our AWS infrastructure, which is covered by our SOC 2 certification, for up to 7 days.

### How is my project data handled and secured during transit and in cache?

We use secure protocols for project data transfer. All project data is encrypted in flight and at rest on our AWS storage infrastructure.

### What personal data does Bezi collect and how is it stored?

See our [Privacy Policy](https://www.bezi.com/privacy-policy) for complete information on what personal data is collected and how it is protected by Bezi.

### Who owns the project data created by Bezi?

You own all scripts and actions generated by Bezi.
