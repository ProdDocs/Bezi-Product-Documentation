title: "Ask Mode"
---

Ask Mode is Bezi’s _informational_ setting. It serves as an Unity project's core knowledgebase, it can be prompted to provide information and cannot take action on your behalf.

To enter Ask Mode, select the **mode dropdown** (below the prompt textbox) and select **Ask**. When you're in Ask Mode, it will look like this:

</Frame>

## What can I do in Ask Mode?

In Ask Mode, Bezi can respond with information, tutorials, and code snippets (that must be implemented by you via copy/paste) to walk you through an implementation or explain a concept.

All Ask Mode responses are customized to work with whatever is in your project at the moment it's prompted, assuming the project is properly indexed. See [Asset Sync](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/asset-sync) docs for more details on that.

## How's Ask Mode different than Agent Mode?

Ask Mode cannot directly implement anything on your behalf in Unity, while Agent Mode can. Consider Ask Mode as **manual** implementation and [Agent Mode](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode) as **automatic** implementation.
