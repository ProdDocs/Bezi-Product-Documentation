title: "Ask Mode"
---

Ask Mode is Bezi’s _informational_ setting. It serves as an Unity project's core knowledgebase, it can be prompted to provide information and cannot take action on your behalf.

Ask Mode cannot directly implement anything on your behalf in Unity, while Agent Mode can. Consider Ask Mode as **manual** implementation and [Agent Mode](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/agent-mode) as **automatic** implementation.

## How do I enter Ask Mode?

To enter Ask Mode, select the **mode dropdown** (below the prompt textbox) and select **Ask**. When you're in Ask Mode, it will look like this:

</Frame>

## What can I do in Ask Mode?

In Ask Mode, Bezi can respond with information, tutorials, and code snippets (that must be implemented by you via copy/paste) to walk you through an implementation or explain a concept.

All Ask Mode responses are customized to work with whatever is in your project at the moment it's prompted, assuming the project is properly indexed. See [Project Indexing](https://docs.bezi.com/context/index-project) docs for more details.
