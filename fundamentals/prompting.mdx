## Correct prompt structure

Current state \> Expected/Ideal state \> Response format you want

Prototype prompt example: “_I have a system for X. I want to adjust it to add Y. Prototype that and describe any necessary setup steps_.”

## Prompt quality = response quality

Bezi cannot read minds; the more specific a prompt, the better! Use these tools to give specifics:

1. Always [**add in-line pins**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/prompt-tagging) to call-out important information (assets, scripts, etc.): type “@” to search
2. [**Attachment images**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/attach-images) (screenshots, Figma UI, etc.) to give Bezi visual context or direction
3. Write [Rules](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/project-rules) to customize Bezi's system prompt, defining how it should navigate and interact with a project and format or communicate its responses
4. Write and pin [Pages](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders) to give Bezi important guidelines or more information for a given task

Rule of thumb: Before submitting a prompt, read it separately from the thread history. Is it very clear what the prompt is referring to and what Bezi's needs to do or create?

If the prompt isn't independently clear to you, Bezi will be confused by it too. Simplify your ask. Pin details. Replace any vague wording (i.e. "_fix_ _errors"_) with the error code / description and expected outcome.

## If you get a response you don’t like, DO NOT PROMPT TO FIX IT

Bezi ingests an active thread's prompt _and_ response history as context. So, if Bezi gives you a response you don't like and you prompt on top of it, Bezi will reference the wrong response as "important context" for its next attempt.

**Two ways to avoid a rabbit-hole**:

1. [Edit the original prompt](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/edit-prompts) and add any information missing in the origional prompt to get the right answer
1. Summarize what you liked from this thread in a Page, start a new thread, @ the Page, and re-ask the question
