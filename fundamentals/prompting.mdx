## Correct prompt structure

Current state \> Expected/Ideal state \> Response format you want

Prototype prompt example: “_I have a system for X. I want to adjust it to add Y. Prototype that and describe any necessary setup steps_.”

## Prompt quality = response quality

Bezi cannot read minds; the more specific a prompt, the better! Use these tools to give specifics:

1. Always [**add in-line pins**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/prompt-tagging) to call-out important information (assets, scripts, etc.): type “@” to search
2. [**Attachment images**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/attach-images) (screenshots, Figma UI, etc.) to give Bezi visual context or direction
3. Write [Rules](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/project-rules) to customize Bezi's system prompt, defining how it should navigate and interact with a project and format or communicate its responses
4. Tag [Pages](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/pages-folders) to give Bezi important guidelines or information needed for given tasks

NEVER use vague wording like "_fix_ _errors"_ - even if the error was mentioned in that thread. Bezi won't know which error you want fixed. You will get a bad response and waste a credit.

## If you get a response you don’t like, DO NOT PROMPT TO FIX IT

Bezi ingests an active thread's prompt _and_ response history as context. So, if Bezi gives you a response you don't like and you prompt on top of it, Bezi will reference the wrong response as "important context" for it's next attempt.

**Two ways to avoid the rabbit-hole**:

1. [Edit the original prompt](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/edit-prompts) & add any information missing in the origional prompt to get the right answer
1. Summarize what you liked from this thread in a Page, start a new thread, @ the Page, and re-ask the question
