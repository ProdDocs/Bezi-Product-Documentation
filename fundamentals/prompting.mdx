## **Correct prompt structure**

Current state, Expected/Ideal state, Response format you want

Prototype example: “_I have a system for X. I want to adjust it to add Y. Prototype that and describe any necessary setup steps_.”

## Prompt quality = response quality

Bezi cannot read minds; the more relevant info, the better! Use these tools to give specifics:

1. Always [**pin relevant project assets, scripts, etc. in-line:**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/prompt-tagging) type “@” to search or select an asset/gameObject in Unity
2. Use [**image attachments**](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/product/attach-images) (screenshots, figma layouts, etc.)
3. Use Rules to customize Bezi's output
4. Write Pages

NEVER use vague wording like "_fix_ _errors"_ - even if the error was mentioned in that thread. Bezi won't know which error you want fixed. You will get a bad response and waste a credit.

## **If you get a response you don’t like, DO NOT PROMPT TO FIX IT**

Bezi ingests an active thread's prompt _and_ response history as context. So, if Bezi gives you a response you don't like and you prompt on top of it, Bezi will reference the wrong response as "important context" for it's next attempt.

**Two ways to avoid the rabbit-hole**:

1. Edit the original prompt & add any information missing in the origional prompt to get the right answer
1. Summarize what you liked from this thread in a Page, start a new thread, @ the Page, and re-ask the question
