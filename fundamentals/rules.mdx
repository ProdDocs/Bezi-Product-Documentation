## What are Project Rules?

Persistent, custom instructions for Bezi to follow. Add Project Rules to ensure all of Bezi’s ouput is consistent with your project structure, preferences, and workflows.

Project Rules only apply to the Unity project they’re set in. There's no way to share Rules between different projects or accounts _yet_ (coming soon).

## Using Project Rules

**Project Rules are universal principles for how Bezi works with a given project**

1. Define project-specific structures and systems
2. Define how Bezi should interact with certain systems or information types
3. Customize response formats, explanations, code style, etc.

To access Project Rules: Click the Sidebar icon in the top left of your app, then select`Project Rules`to open the page.

**How to decide if information should live in a Rule or a Page:**

- **RULE**: Define how Bezi should interact with information in Unity and Pages, game-wide "constants" so Bezi doesn't have to think about them, etc.
- **PAGE**: Explain how a specific thing works, how something should be implemented, etc,

## Guide to writing Project Rules

Project Rules comes with pre-written examples. These are not customized to your project. You need to edit them or write your own from scratch.

### Write project rules as you'd write instructions to a new member of your team.

1. Write clear and concise rules, using natural language
2. Provide positive examples Bezi can follow
3. Do not overwhelm Bezi with too many rules - it will miss something

  <Tab title="ALWAYS do">
    1. **ALWAYS write direct, clear instructions**: only use decisive verbs and be very specific
       1. GOOD: Follow code style rules defined in [**MyProjectStyle.md**](http://MyProjectStyle.md)
       2. GOOD: NEVER use the Singleton design pattern
       3. BAD: write good code
       4. BAD: follow all SOLID principles
    1. **Always add real, positive examples from the project**: For each rule, find examples of you want Bezi to copy and list as many as possible, to help Bezi recognize the patterns
    2. **Use strong language**: Use caps and clear words like “_ALWAYS_,” “_IMPORTANT_,” and “_CRITICAL_” to signal importance
    3. **Prioritize by importance**: Place CRITICAL rules at the top, and move less important ones down
    4. **Enrich references**: Provide library name, version, official website, and a direct link to scripting examples
    1. **Update your rules regularly**: Rules must evolve alonside your project. We don't recommend asking Bezi to write your project rules, as you know what is most important.
    2. **Keep Project Rules succinct**: Make sure to remove old rules and keep the document brief. Too much information will increase likelihood Bezi misses something
