title: "Agent Mode"

Agent Mode is Bezi’s _actionable_ setting. It understands your entire Unity project and can create and modify scripts directly, simplifying the suggestion to implementation process. You can keep or undo proposed code, compare diffs, and immediately test suggestions in-Unity.

To enter Agent Mode, select the **mode dropdown** (below the prompt textbox) and select **Agent**. When you’re in Agent Mode, it will look like this:'

## How's Agent Mode different than Ask Mode?

Agent Mode will directly implement changes in Unity on your behalf, while Ask Mode cannot. Consider Agent Mode as **automatic** implementation and [Ask Mode](https://docs.bezi.com/bezi/modes/ask-mode) as **manual** implementation.

## How do I use Agent Mode?

### Agent Mode suggestion states

<Tip>
  We recommend you keep or undo suggestions as you work. Allowing suggestions to remain undecided may lead to unintentionally keeping suggestions that you did not want implemented.
</Tip>

Proposed changes (i.e. suggestions) from Agent Mode can exist in three states.

**Undecided**: Suggestions that have not been kept or undone

**Kept**: Suggestions that you have opted to keep, which can happen in two ways

- **Directly Kept**: You reviewed suggestion(s) and pressed `Keep` or `Keep All` button
- **Indirectly Kept**: You left suggestion(s) undecided and decided to keep a suggestion later on that iterated on the proposed code

**Rejected**: Suggestions that you have opted to undo, by pressing the `Undo` or `Undo All` button

- To undo suggestion(s), be sure to select the `Undo` or `Undo All` button, ideally as soon as you decide you do not want to implement them

### Code generation and modification

All Agent Mode suggestions are implemented by default so you can test them in context before deciding to keep or undo them. When you receive a suggestion in Agent Mode, it's best practice to test the suggestion(s) in Unity, return to Bezi to keep what you like and/or undo what you don't, and then prompt again to iterate.

When Bezi suggests a script with the `Keep` or `Undo` option, it's been created and is viewable in Unity. This is what happens if you select either option:

1. `Keep` / `Keep All`: this will not change anything, the script already exists in Unity and will stay as-is
2. `Undo` / `Undo All`: this will remove any Bezi changes, either deleting new files created or reverting any changes made to an existing file

**Keeping or Undoing a suggestion is a non-reversible action**. Once either button is clicked, you can't return to the undecided state. If you wish to implement a suggestion you undid, you can return to that section, copy it from the chat or in canvas, and manually implement it (as you would in Ask Mode).

### Restore Checkpoint

If you want to bring the project back to an earlier state and erase any kept changes from after that state, use **Restore Checkpoint**.

For example, if you go down a rabbit hole working on a particular mechanic with Bezi, only to get feedback that your second iteration is the right direction; you can restore to that response and continue to iterate from there.

Hoever over the Bezi responses you want to revert to and select the `Restore Checkpoint` button to go back to a specific conclusive state.

<Note>
  Restore Checkpoint does not revert Agent Mode suggestions to an undecided state. It erases all code additions/modifications made by Bezi after the conclusive point.
</Note>

### Diffs

We use **diffs** to indicate exactly what changes are being to files:

- **red highlights**: deletions made within a file
- **green highlights**: additions made within a file

In chat, modifications are shown compressed to be glanceable.

To view in the context of the entire script, open the script in **Canvas** (diffs will remain highlighted). This is intended to be a clearer way to show suggested changes in the script as a whole, so you can:

- Compare the update to the original, for confidence that Bezi’s doing the right thing
- Identify exactly where a change is being made, versus receiving a snippet out of context and having to guess where it fits into the larger script

### Asset Drawer

The Asset Drawer lists all created and modified files. It sits above the prompt box so you can view all changes made in the duration of a thread in one place and bulk keep or undo a response's suggestions.
