Agent Mode is Bezi’s _actionable_ setting. It can directly implement changes in Unity on your behalf, while Ask Mode cannot. Consider Agent Mode as **automatic** implementation and Ask Mode as **manual** implementation.

Agent Mode takes action in the Unity Editor via scripts and Actions. Before using Agent Mode, review the [Actions documentation](https://docs.bezi.com/fundamentals/agent-mode-actions).

## What can Bezi do in Agent Mode?

Agent Mode Scripts enables Bezi to create and modify scripts in Unity on your behalf.

When Agent Mode's Actions is enabled, Bezi can automatically create, update, and organize scenes, game objects, prefabs, and assets on your behalf in the Unity editor.

You can immediately test suggestions in-Unity (script or Actions) and easily keep or undo proposed changes.

## How to enter Agent Mode

Select the **mode dropdown** (below the prompt textbox) and select **Agent**. When you’re in Agent Mode, it will look like this:

<Frame>
  ![Agentmode](/images/agentmode.png)
</Frame>

<Tip>
  We recommend you keep or undo suggestions as you work. Allowing suggestions to remain undecided may lead to unintentionally keeping suggestions that you did not want implemented.
</Tip>

## Agent Mode states

Proposed changes from Agent Mode can exist in three states.

**Undecided**: Suggestions that have not been kept or undone

**Kept**: Suggestions that you have opted to keep, which can happen in two ways

- **Directly Kept**: you reviewed suggestion(s) and pressed `Keep` or `Keep All` button
- **Indirectly Kept**: accepting a code suggestion accepts ALL suggestions up to that point in the thread

**Rejected**: Suggestions that you have opted to undo, by pressing the `Undo` or `Undo All` button

- To undo suggestion(s), be sure to select the `Undo` or `Undo All` button, ideally as soon as you decide you do not want to implement them
- Rejecting a code suggestion in-thread will only revert it to the previous undecided version

## How to preview and keep / undo proposed changes

All Agent Mode suggestions are implemented by default so you can test them in context before deciding to keep or undo them. When you receive a suggestion in Agent Mode, it's best practice to test the suggestion(s) in Unity, return to Bezi to keep what you like and/or undo what you don't, and then prompt again to iterate.

When Bezi suggests a script with the `Keep` or `Undo` option, it's been created and is viewable in Unity. This is what happens if you select either option:

1. `Keep` / `Keep All`: this will not change anything, the script already exists in Unity and will stay as-is
2. `Undo` / `Undo All`: this will remove any Bezi changes, either deleting new files created or reverting any changes made to an existing file

**Keeping or Undoing a suggestion is a non-reversible action**. Once either button is clicked, you can't return to the undecided state. If you wish to implement a suggestion you undid, you can return to that section, copy it from the chat or in canvas, and manually implement it (as you would in Ask Mode).

## Restore Checkpoint

If you want to bring the project back to an earlier state and erase any kept changes from after that state, use **Restore Checkpoint**.

For example, if you go down a rabbit hole working on a particular mechanic with Bezi, only to get feedback that your second iteration is the right direction; you can restore to that response and continue to iterate from there. All changes that happened after that point will be cleared.

Hover over the Bezi response you want to revert to and select the `Restore Checkpoint` button to return back.

<Note>
  Restore Checkpoint does not revert Agent Mode suggestions to an undecided state. It erases all code additions/modifications made by Bezi after the conclusive point.
</Note>

## Diffs

We use **diffs** to indicate exactly what changes are being made to files:

- **red highlights**: deletions made within a file
- **green highlights**: additions made within a file

In chat, modifications are shown compressed to be glanceable.

To view in the context of the entire script, open the script in **Canvas** (diffs will remain highlighted). This is intended to be a clearer way to show suggested changes in the script as a whole, so you can:

- Compare the update to the original, for confidence that Bezi’s doing the right thing
- Identify exactly where a change is being made, versus receiving a snippet out of context and having to guess where it fits into the larger script

## Asset Drawer

The Asset Drawer lists all created and modified files. It sits above the prompt box so you can view all changes made in the duration of a thread in one place and bulk keep or undo a response's suggestions.

If you accept or reject a code suggestion in the Asset Drawer, it will auto-accept or auto-reject all outstanding changeg - making full-accept or full-revert.
