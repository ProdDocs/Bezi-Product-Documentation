title: "Agent Mode Actions (beta)"
---

When Agent Mode's Actions is enabled, Bezi can automatically create, update, and organize scenes, game objects, prefabs, and assets on your behalf in the Unity editor.

<Note>
  Not all Unity editor actions are supported yet. Bezi supports a growing subset of Unity editor actions and we intentionally limit destructive actions.

## How Actions works

When you prompt Bezi with **Agent Mode** toggled on, the Agent may choose one or more in-editor actions to accomplish your request.

- The Agent decides **which actions** to use based on your intent
- Multiple actions can be chained together to complete complex tasks
- Actions only apply to the **currently open Unity project** and its assets

For more control on which Actions Bezi takes, explicitly state the name of the action(s) you want used in the prompt.

## How to preview, save / undo or revert changes

See the Agent Mode docs for complete details on the states that changes exist in and how to manage each one.

## How to turn off Actions for your Bezi instance

Actions is a **beta feature** and can be disabled if you prefer to use Agent Mode without it.

1. Open **Account Settings**
2. Find the **Beta Features** section
3. Toggle **In-editor actions** off

When Actions are disabled, Bezi Agent Mode will continue to reason, explain, and generate or modify scripts in Bezi. But it will not do anything described on this docs page.

## Prompt examples

1. Prototype faster without manual editor setup
   - **Prompt Example**: “_Create a prefab for the player, and attach the necessary physics components and scripts._”
   - **Prompt Example**: “_Create a new ScriptableObject for weapon stats and link it to this prefab._”
2. Apply consistent changes across many objects
   - **Prompt Example**: “_Add a CapsuleCollider to all enemies in the current scene_.”
3. Iterate on an existing project without context switching
   - **Prompt Example**: "_Whitebox the UI slider for the health tracker, and update the HealthManager to use it._"
4. Execute repetitive or mechanical editor work instantly
   - **Prompt Example**: “_Update the Menu UI so achievements stack vertically._”
   - **Prompt Example**: “_Set up Hinge Joints and colliders for all doors tagged 'Openable'._”

Natural language works great but, if you want deterministic behavior, be explicit:

- “_Use Actions to create a prefab from @[game object name]_.”
