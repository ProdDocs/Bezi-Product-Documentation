title: "Agent Mode: Actions (beta)"
---

When Agent Mode's Actions is enabled, Bezi can automatically create, update, and organize scenes, game objects, prefabs, and assets on your behalf in the Unity editor.

<Note>
  Not all Unity editor actions are supported yet. Bezi supports a growing subset of Unity editor actions and we intentionally limit destructive actions.

## How Actions works

When you prompt Bezi with **Agent Mode** toggled on, the Agent may choose one or more in-editor actions to accomplish your request.

- The Agent decides **which actions** to use based on your intent
- Multiple actions can be chained together to complete complex tasks
- Actions only apply to the **currently open Unity project** and its assets

For more control on which Actions Bezi takes, explicitly state the name of the action(s) you want used in the prompt.

## How to preview, save / undo and rollback Actions

See the Agent Mode docs for complete details on the three states that changes exist in and how to manage each one.
