title: "Agent Mode: Actions (beta)"
---

Agent Mode is Bezi’s _actionable_ setting. When enabled, it will make real changes in your Unity project. It does this via [scripts](https://docs.bezi.com/fundamentals/agent-mode) or Actions, which is a group of non-script based work Bezi can do for you directly in the Unity editor.

When Agent Mode's Actions is enabled, Bezi can automatically create, update, and organize scenes, game objects, prefabs, and assets on your behalf in the Unity editor.

<Note>
  Not all Unity editor actions are supported yet. Bezi supports a growing subset of Unity editor actions and we intentionally limit destructive actions.

## How Actions work

When you prompt Bezi with **Agent Mode** toggled on, the Agent may choose one or more in-editor actions to accomplish your request.

- The Agent decides **which actions** to use based on your intent
- Multiple actions can be chained together to complete complex tasks
- Actions only apply to the **currently open Unity project** and its assets

For more control on which Actions Bezi takes, explicitly state the name of the action(s) you want used in the prompt. 

## How to preview and undo Actions

**Preview before applying**

You can see pending changes before you keep or undo them. See the Agent Mode docs for more information on the three states that changes can exist in and how to manage each one. 

**Undo and rollback**

You can undo actions just like other Agent Mode changes, or roll back to a previous checkpoint from earlier prompts.
