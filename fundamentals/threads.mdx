Threads are a series of prompts and responses. Bezi uses an active thread (the thread you're working in) prompt and response history as context to inform future answers in that thread.

Create new threads frequently so Bezi only uses relevant context and keeps response quality high.

1. Keep threads short, **10 or less prompts per thread**
2. **1 topic per thread**: start a new thread when the topic or task changes!

## **Thread navigation**

Each project connected to Bezi has its own thread history. If you can't find a specific thread, first confirm you're looking in the right project.

**Access threads**: select the icon in the top left of the app

**Start a new thread**: select the **\+** icon in the Threads section

**View a thread split-screen with Pages/Rules**: select the icon in the top right of the thread view

**Reopen old threads:** click on any thread name to reopen it. You can scroll through past responses or submit new prompts to pick up the conversation where you left off.

If you submit a prompt in one thread then open another thread (existing or new), the prompt will cancel. To avoid spending credits on canceled prompts, wait for the prompt response before leaving the existing thread.
