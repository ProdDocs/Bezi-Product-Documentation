Threads are a series of prompts and responses. Bezi uses an active thread (the thread you're working in) prompt and response history as context to inform future answers in that thread. 

Create new threads frequently so Bezi only has relevant context and response quality stays high.

1. Keep threads short, **10 or less prompts per thread**
2. **1 topic per thread**: start a new thread when the topic or task changes!

Each project connected to Bezi has its own thread history.
