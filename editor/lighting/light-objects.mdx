## Using Light objects \[missing gif]

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding Light objects to a scene" defaultOpen={false}>
    Light objects can be added to a scene in two ways:

    1\. Open the **Command Center**, type "light", and select the desired Light object

    2\. Open **Objects** in the top toolbar and select the desired Light object
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Positioning Lights to 'look at' objects" defaultOpen={false}>
    Click the Light object's handle and drag the sphere to the object you want the light to face.&#x20;

## Light object types \[missing assets]

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Point Light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Point Light is an omni-directional point of light. Itâ€™s a small sphere that emits light in all directions.

    Point Light objects can be customized using range and rate of decay properties.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Area Light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Area Light is a light source emitting light from a surface. It's frequently used to simulate a computer screen, a window, or a ceiling light.

    Area Light objects can be customized using dimension properties.&#x20;

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Spot Light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Spot Light emits light in the form of a cone-shape in a defined direction.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Directional Light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Directional Light is a light that is emitted in a single direction from infinitely far away. It's often used to replicate the light effect from the sun.

## Light object settings \[missing gif]

All Light objects share these common settings.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Color" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the color tint of the emitted light.

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Intensity" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how intense the light is. The higher the number, the more intense it is.

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Light object properties

Some Light objects have additional properties that can be used to customize them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Range" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the maximum range of the light. If distance is zero, light does not reduce. If distance is non-zero, light will reduce linearly from maximum intensity (at the Light object's position) to zero (at the distance from the Light object).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate of decay" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the amount the light dims along the distance of the Light object.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dimension" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the size of the Area Light.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Angle" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the maximum extent of the spotlight, in degrees, from its direction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Softness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the percent of the Spot Light cone that is reduced due to penumbra.
  </Accordion>
