## What is performance?&#x20;

Performance is optimizing a the components of a scene so that it works smoothly on the intended device. It's a crucial part of the design process because, if a scene lags or glitches when played, it will not deliver the desired user experience.&#x20;

## Scene-level performance&#x20;

It’s important to have a high-level picture of how a scene performs as it's being designer. Below are the parts of the Performance Panel that help diagnose a scene's general performance.&#x20;

### Preview Bar&#x20;

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Performance warning">
    The **Performance warning** icon (orange triangle next to Performance panel name) appears when the defined target device is at risk of being non-performant.

## Asset-level performance \[assets]

Assets are critical to a scene experience. However, assets are often the cause of poor performance when properties such as polycount and material size aren't monitored and optimized. The following parts of the Performance Panel can help analyze asset performance and identify potential risks.&#x20;

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Object selection & overview">
    Select an object in the hierarchy to get an overview of its properties and performance in the Performance Panel. Multiple objects can be selected at once to give a combined overview.

    \[asset]
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Object view">
    Gain insight into individual assets like geometry, materials, and others. Hover over individual attributes to view data or use the right-side viewport to get a visual representation.

    \[asset]
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Right-side viewport">
    When a selected asset is being inspected in the Geometry or Materials sections, a viewport will appear on the right side to display the asset. This can be used to gather insight into the asset or link to other linked root properties.

    \[asset]
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Secondary selection \[assets]

It's possible to select an object in a scene from within the Performance Panel's right-side viewport to get more context on it.&#x20;

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Object selection">
    Within the right-side viewport, click the arrow icon in the top right corner to select an object in the scene.

    \[asset]
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Instance selection">
    Oftentimes there's a component or material instance used multiple times in a scene. If you want to get more context on something, navigate to the right side viewport, however over it, and click the  **arrow** icon to “Select all in scene”.
