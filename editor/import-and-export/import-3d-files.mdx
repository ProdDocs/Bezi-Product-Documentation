## Importing 3D files

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supported file formats and weights" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Editor currently supports GLB, FBX, and OBJ file formats. All files must be in one of these three formats in order to be imported.&#x20;

    All imported files should be under 100k polys, if at all possible. Any files over this limit risk affecting the speed and performance of a scene.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Textures" defaultOpen={false}>
    To have accurate textures applied, the models must be unwrapped.&#x20;

    To have imported textures applied automatically, they must be packaged into a GLB file. Use this [free online tool](https://sbtron.github.io/makeglb/) to convert a GLTF file to a GLB file.&#x20;

    If textures are in a separate folder, follow these steps:

    1. Upload the geometry file&#x20;

    2. Upload the image textures for the model, following the below instructions&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Surfaces" defaultOpen={false}>
    Every surface is treated as single-sided by default.&#x20;
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
