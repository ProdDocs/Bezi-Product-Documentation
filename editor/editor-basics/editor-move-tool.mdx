## Using the Move tool \[missing gif]

To activate the Move tool press `m` + `spacebar`&#x20;

Once active, select the object you want to move. This sets the point of interest so you can snap a certain point to another object.

The selected object then moves freely, depending on the mouse pointerâ€™s location and camera

Once you're satisfied with placement, click to commit the action.
