## Using Parametric objects

Parametric objects are shapes that can be easily edited in a non-destructive way. Primitive objects (e.g. box, sphere, cylinder, cone, plane) are considered Parametric objects, and can be added to a scene through the **Command Center** or the **Objects** dropdown in the top toolbar.

Once added to a scene, the parameters can be adjusted in the right sidebar under **Shape**.
