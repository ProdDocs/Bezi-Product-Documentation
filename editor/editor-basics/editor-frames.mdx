# What are Frames?

Frames act as containers that provide additional control over nested objects with enhanced functionalities. Frames allow you to build everything from individual elements, to entire spaces and UI surfaces.

Similar to Groups, you can adjust the properties of a frame including its dimensions and visibility.

Frames enable other features including constraints, clipping, align and distribute, and additional State Machine capabilities.
