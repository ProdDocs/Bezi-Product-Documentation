# What are Frames?

Frames act as containers that provide additional control over nested objects with enhanced functionalities. Frames allow you to build everything from individual elements, to entire spaces and UI surfaces.

Similar to Groups, you can adjust the properties of a frame including its dimensions and visibility.

Frames enable other features including constraints, clipping, align and distribute, and additional State Machine capabilities.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Constraints" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be constrained to any of the Frame’s faces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clipping" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be clipped by the parent Frame.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Align and Distribute" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be aligned and distributed based on the Frame’s boundaries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Frames

There are four ways to create Frames in Bezi.

<Note>
  If you have objects selected in your canvas, the Frame will automatically be created around them. If there aren’t any active selections, you can draw a Frame in the viewport.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Center" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select the **Bezi** icon in the top toolbar to open the **Command Center**

    2. Type “fr” into the search bar

    3. Select **Frame** from the dropdown, this will create a Frame in the scene&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Toolbar" defaultOpen={false}>
    Select the **Frame** (#) icon in the toolbar to create a Frame in the scene.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contextual menu" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select an object(s) in the scene

    2. Right-click and select **Frame** from the contextual menu dropdown
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard shortcut" defaultOpen={false}>
    For macOS type: `opt` + `⌘` + `g`

    For PC type: `ctrl` + `alt` + `g`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Frames for clipping

Enable clipping on Frames to hide the children objects that extend beyond the Frame’s boundary.





## Using constraints on Frames

Constraints dictate how nested objects behave when their parent Frame’s size changes. Constraints can be applied to objects that are inside a Frame.





## Align and Distribute within Frames







## Using Frames with the State Machine

Frames can have states, and each Frame state can manage multiple nested object’s states. Nested objects listen to the state of the parent Frame, so you can manage all nested objects within the parent Frame’s state machine.
