# What are Frames?

Frames act as containers that provide additional control over nested objects with enhanced functionalities. Frames allow you to build everything from individual elements, to entire spaces and UI surfaces.

Similar to Groups, you can adjust the properties of a frame including its dimensions and visibility.

Frames enable other features including constraints, clipping, align and distribute, and additional State Machine capabilities.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Constraints" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be constrained to any of the Frame’s faces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clipping" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be clipped by the parent Frame.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Align and Distribute" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be aligned and distributed based on the Frame’s boundaries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Frames

There are four ways to create Frames in Bezi.

<Note>
  If you have objects selected in your canvas, the Frame will automatically be created around them. If there aren’t any active selections, you can draw a Frame in the viewport.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Center" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select the **Bezi** icon in the top toolbar to open the **Command Center**

    2. Type “fr” into the search bar

    3. Select **Frame** from the dropdown, this will create a Frame in the scene&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Toolbar" defaultOpen={false}>
    Select the **Frame** (#) icon in the toolbar to create a Frame in the scene.

    ![](/images/Frame_main_menu.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contextual menu" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select an object(s) in the scene

    2. Right-click and select **Frame** from the contextual menu dropdown
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard shortcut" defaultOpen={false}>
    For macOS type: `opt` + `⌘` + `g`

    For PC type: `ctrl` + `alt` + `g`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Frames for clipping

Enable clipping on Frames to hide the children objects that extend beyond the Frame’s boundary.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Enabling Frame clipping" defaultOpen={false}>
    To enable clipping, select a Frame, go to the Properties Panel, and check the **Clip content** box.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adding caps to clipped objects" defaultOpen={false}>
    Enabling caps renders a solid color on a Frame’s nested objects where the Frame’s boundary and its nested objects intersect. Cap colors can be changed in the Properties Panel.

    <Tip>
      Each Frame renders its own caps and cap colors. If you need a different cap color inside a Frame, try nesting each object in its own Frame.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using constraints on Frames

Constraints dictate how nested objects behave when their parent Frame’s size changes. Constraints can be applied to objects that are inside a Frame.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding constraints" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Confirm there are one or more objects nested in a Frame&#x20;

    2. Select the nested objects

    3. Go to the Properties Panel and find the **Constraints** section&#x20;

    4. Click the **+** icon in the Constraints section of the Properties Panel

    <Tip>
      By default, constraints are set to Left (-X), Bottom(-Y) and Back (-Z).
    </Tip>

    ![](/images/add_constraints.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changing constraint settings" defaultOpen={false}>
    Within the Constraints section of the Properties Panel, hover over the the **X axis**, **Y axis**, and **Z axis** icons. Drop menus will appear for each.&#x20;

    Hover over each item in the drop menus to preview which axis the constraint setting will be applied on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-face constraints" defaultOpen={false}>
    Use multi-face constraints to constrain nested objects to opposite faces (ex. +X and -X). The result is the object scaling in both directions on an axis.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Removing a constraint" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select the nested object with the constraints

    2. Go to the Constraints section of the Properties Panel&#x20;

    3. Select the **-** icon![](/images/remove_constraints.png)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Align and Distribute within Frames

When one or more nested objects are selected, the align and distribute options appear at the top of the Properties Panel. Objects within their parent Frame can be aligned or distributed relative to to the Frame or each other, allowing for precise and efficient positioning.

There are two align and distribute modes to choose between: Within Frame and Selected Objects.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Within Frame mode" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Within Frame mode will align and distribute based on the parent Frame’s boundaries.

    ![](/images/align_controls_frames.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Selected Objects mode" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Selected Objects mode will ignore the Frame and align and distribute the selected objects relative to each other.

    ![](/images/align_controls_objects.png)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  You can align and distribute nested objects within different Frames at the same time. The selected objects will always respect their own parent Frame.
</Tip>

## Using Frames with the State Machine

Frames can have states, and each Frame state can manage multiple nested object’s states. Nested objects listen to the state of the parent Frame, so you can manage all nested objects within the parent Frame’s state machine.
