# What are Frames?

Frames act as containers that provide additional control over nested objects with enhanced functionalities. Frames allow you to build everything from individual elements, to entire spaces and UI surfaces.

Similar to Groups, you can adjust the properties of a frame including its dimensions and visibility.

Frames enable other features including constraints, clipping, align and distribute, and additional State Machine capabilities.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Constraints" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be constrained to any of the Frame’s faces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clipping" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be clipped by the parent Frame.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Align and Distribute" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects nested within a Frame can be aligned and distributed based on the Frame’s boundaries.

## Creating Frames

There are four ways to create Frames in Bezi.

<Note>
  If you have objects selected in your canvas, the Frame will automatically be created around them. If there aren’t any active selections, you can draw a Frame in the viewport.
