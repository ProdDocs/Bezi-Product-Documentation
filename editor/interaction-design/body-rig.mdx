## Using the Body Rig&#x20;

The Body Rig is a digital canvas for the human body and the body a viewer inhabits in an Editor prototype. The ability to parent objects and/or add behaviors to the Body Rig enables a human-centric experience.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding a Body Rig to a scene" defaultOpen={false}>
    Body Rigs can be added to a scene in three ways. We suggest **placing the Body Rig at Y:1** in the world space because objects around it are often placed at X:0 Y:0 Z:0.&#x20;

    1. Open **Objects** menu in the top toolbar and select the Body Rig object

    2. Open the **Command Center**, type “rig”, and select the Body Rig object

    3. Select an **AR template** or **VR template** when starting a new scene. Both have a Body Rig included by default
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parenting objects to the Body Rig" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects can be parented to any element of the Body Rig. To do so, drag an object into either the head, hand, or body.

    Once the object is inside a Body Rig element, position it where it should appear on the human form.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using behaviors with the Body Rig" defaultOpen={false}>
    Behaviors that are applied to other objects can target Body Rig elements and their children, but the Body Rig cannot have a behavior on it to follow another object.

    For example, creating a panel that follows and looks at the Body Rig head allows for accurate placement and dynamic interactions.&#x20;

## Body Rig elements
