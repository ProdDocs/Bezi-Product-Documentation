## Adding physics

1. Select any object, empty, or light in the Editor scene&#x20;

2. Go to the Properties Panel&#x20;

3. Find the "Physics" section

4. Press the **+** button to add physics to it

## Gravity

Once physics is added to an object, empty, or light, adjust the gravity of it in the Physics section of the Properties Panel.&#x20;

## Related properties

Use collider's mass, friction, and bounce properties to customize physics. To enable these properties, a solid collider must be placed on the same object, light, or empty. See the [Collider documentation](https://bezi.mintlify.app/editor/interaction-design/colliders) for more information.
