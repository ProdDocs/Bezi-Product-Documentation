## Using colliders

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Turning on colliders" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select any object, empty, or light in the Editor scene&#x20;

    2. Go to the Properties Panel&#x20;

    3. Find the "Colliders" section

    4. Press the **+** button to add a collider to the scene ![](/images/find-collider.png)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Viewing colliders in a scene" defaultOpen={false}>
    When colliders are turned, on a rainbow box outline will represent them in the scene. You can have multiple colliders in a scene or on a single object.

</AccordionGroup>

## Collider types

In Bezi their are two types of colliders; trigger colliders and solid colliders. By default, colliders  default to the trigger collider. Click the **dotted circle** icon to switch collider types.&#x20;

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trigger colliders" defaultOpen={false}>
    Trigger colliders detect when another collider, trigger or solid, enters its space. These colliders can trigger actions in a scene.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Solid colliders" defaultOpen={false}>
    Solid colliders enable objects to collide with other solid colliders. Solid colliders have mass, friction, and bounce. When physics are enabled you can change these parameters to change the effect of the collider.

## Collider shapes

There are three collider shapes: box, sphere, and capsule. Changing these will effect the how colliders interact with the world.

## Collider parameters

Colliders have editable parameters, such as: size, position, and rotation to scale. By default, all colliders are auto-fit to their parent object's transform properties. Checking or unchecking the **Auto size** box will transform the objects size.

Below the **Auto size** box is padding. When Auto-side is checked, padding can be used to give consistent spacing as needed.
