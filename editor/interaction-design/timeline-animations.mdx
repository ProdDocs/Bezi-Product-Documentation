description: "Design engaging scene animations using duration, delay, and animation curves. Attach them to a specific trigger event to create continuity with interactions built in the State Machine. "

<Info>
  The Animation Timeline is used alongside the State Machine to create interactive scenes. Please familiarize yourself with the [State Machine](https://docs.bezi.com/editor/interaction-design/state-machine-interactions) before implementing Animations!

## Using the Timeline \[missing assets]

<Steps>
  <Step title="Opening the Timeline">
    1. Select the **State Machine** button in the bottom bar to open the State Machine panel

    2. Select the **Timeline** icon on the top right of the State Machine panel

    3. The Timeline panel will open in the right half of the State Machine panel

  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding the Timeline">
    The Timeline shows what State transitions are triggered by a selected object.&#x20;

    In the example below, the apple moves from ‘Base State’ to ‘Orange’ when ‘Box’ (on pointer down) is selected. ‘Box’ is the trigger object and ‘On pointer down’ is the filtered event. This means the Timeline will show all Animations tied to that trigger.&#x20;

## Filtering Animations by trigger event \[missing asset]

1. Open the Timeline panel inside the State Machine panel

2. Select the dropdown next to the object name in the Timeline

## Previewing a Timeline object's 'from' and 'to' states \[missing asset]

1. Open the Timeline panel inside the State Machine panel

2. Find the object's row in the Timeline

3. Find the **State Transition** column

4. Click on the State names inside the column (in the example image, the 'from' state is "Base State" and the 'to' state is "State 1")
