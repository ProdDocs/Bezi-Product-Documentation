## Troubleshooting&#x20;

Depending on the file size and network conditions, occasionally models or image textures are slower to load. If you encounter this, wait for a few minutes and confirm network connection stability. If the entire scene doesn't come into view a few minutes, contact Bezi support at [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com) or on [Discord](https://bezel.it/community).
