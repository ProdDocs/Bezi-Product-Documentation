## Move comments

Because comments are pinned to objects, if an object is moved the comment will move with it.&#x20;

## Hide comments in the Editor view

Visibility of pinned comments in the Editor can be turned on or off.&#x20;

Open the Command Center, type "show comments", and press `spacebar` to toggle visibility on/off.

## Delete comments

In the comment pop-up, select the **…** icon and select **Delete** from the dropdown.&#x20;

> Deleted comments are permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

## Archive comments

In the comment pop-up, select the **…** icon and select **Archive** from the dropdown.

> Archived comments help keep a record of feedback for a design. Once a comment is archived, it's available in the Archived Comments section. Go into Comment mode to access the Archived Comments section.
