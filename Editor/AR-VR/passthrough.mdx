## Setting up passthrough

All new files are AR by default, meaning passthrough is automatically available when the prototype file is opened in an AR device (phone or headset).&#x20;

1. Put on your headset&#x20;

2. Open the file in the VR browser

   1. Select the **headset** icon to enter the file in immersive mode

   2. Select the **play** icon to enter the file in immersive play mode, which includes all interactions and animations

3. Voila! The designs should be seen in passthrough
