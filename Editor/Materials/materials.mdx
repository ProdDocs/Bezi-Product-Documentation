## Material properties

Materials share a set of properties, depending on the type of material:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Color" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the color of the material.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Opacity" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how transparent the material is.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metalness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how much a material reflects its surroundings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Roughness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how glossy or matte a material is.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Normal" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how lighting bounces off a surface of a material. This requires a normal map to be uploaded to the Normal channel.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Material types \[missing assets]

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A standard Physically Based Rendering material (PBR) provides a more accurate representation of how light interacts with material properties.&#x20;

    Standard materials share all of the material properties outlined above.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unlit material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A unlit material is not affected by its surrounding lights. It’s usually used to create UI that doesn’t need to respond to light, or to produce a flat-shading appearance.&#x20;

    Unlit materials only share color and opacity.&#x20;
