## Material properties

Materials share a set of properties, depending on the type of material:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Color" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the color of the material or the material's shadow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Opacity" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how transparent the material is.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metalness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how much a material reflects its surroundings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Roughness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how glossy or matte a material is.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Normal" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control how lighting bounces off a surface of a material. This requires a normal map to be uploaded to the Normal channel.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Material types \[missing assets]

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A standard Physically Based Rendering material (PBR) provides a more accurate representation of how light interacts with material properties.&#x20;

    Standard materials share all of the material properties outlined above.

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unlit material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A unlit material is not affected by its surrounding lights. It’s usually used to create UI that doesn’t need to respond to light, or to produce a flat-shading appearance.&#x20;

    Unlit materials only share color and opacity properties.&#x20;

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Toon material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A toon material is stylized, non-photorealistic and gives objects a cartoon-like look.&#x20;

    Toon materials may have strange artifacts if both **Cast Shadows** and **Receive Shadows** are toggled on. We recommend turning one of them off to improve the look.

    Toon materials only share color (shadow), opacity, and normal properties.&#x20;

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shadow material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A shadow material can receive shadows and is otherwise completely transparent.

    The shadow color applied to the shadow material dictates the color of the shadow. For example, if a white color is used for the shadow material, it will have a white shadow.

    Shadow materials only share color (shadow) and opacity properties.&#x20;

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Occluder material" defaultOpen={false}>
    An occluder material is invisible and hide any objects rendered behind it. Occluder materials are often used to create portal-like effects.&#x20;

    Occluder materials only share color (shadow) and opacity properties. For occluder materials opacity is a toggle, not a smooth transition.&#x20;

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Physical material" defaultOpen={false}>
    A physical material provide more advanced physically-based rendering properties and can have advanced properties applied to them.&#x20;

    Physical materials share all of the material properties, as well as the following advanced properties:

    **Glass**: create the look of glass or frosted glass.&#x20;

    * Thickness: control the thickness of volume beneath the surface

    * Transmission: control how transparent it is

    * Index of refraction (Ior): control the refraction of light inside the object

    **Sheen**: create the look of cloth and fabric materials.&#x20;

    * Color: control the color of the sheen layer

    * Roughness: control how rough or glossy the sheen is

    **Clearcoat**: create the look of car paint, carbon fiber, and wet surfaces by adding a reflective layer on top of another layer.

    * Roughness: control how rough or glossy the reflective layer is
