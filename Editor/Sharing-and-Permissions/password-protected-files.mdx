## Viewing protected files

Once a password is set, anyone that has the file link but doesn't have edit or view access must enter the password. This includes people within the same Bezi Org.&#x20;

Entering the correct password will enable viewing the file only.&#x20;

## Editing protected files

For a non-file owner to edit a protected file, the file owner must invite them to the file and grant them Editor access. For instructions on how to do this, see the File Permission documentation \[link to "add people to file" section of docs page]
