## Viewing protected files

Once a password is set, anyone that has the file link but doesn't have edit or view access must enter the password. This includes people within the same Bezi Org.&#x20;

Entering the correct password will enable viewing the file only. To edit a file, the person must be invited to the file as an Editor. To add someone as an Editor to a file, follow the File Permission documentation \[link to "add people to file" section of docs page]
