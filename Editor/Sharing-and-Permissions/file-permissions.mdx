## Sharing files with a link&#x20;

Any file can be shared by copying and pasting the file's URL. By default, all files are set to 'Anyone with the link can edit'.&#x20;

To adjust this permission level, click the **Share** button in the top toolbar, open the **Invite** section in the popover, and customize permissions using the 'Share file link' dropdowns.&#x20;
