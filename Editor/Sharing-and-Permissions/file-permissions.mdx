## Sharing files with a link&#x20;

Any file can be shared by copying and pasting the file's URL. By default, all files are set to 'Anyone with the link can edit'.&#x20;

To adjust this permission level, click the **Share** button in the top toolbar, open the **Invite** section in the popover, and customize permissions using the 'Share file link' dropdowns.&#x20;

## Permission levels for files shared with a link

When sharing a file using its link, there are three file permission level options:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Anyone with the link can edit" defaultOpen={false}>
    The receiver of the file link can edit the file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Anyone with the link can view" defaultOpen={false}>
    The receiver of the file link can view and comment on the file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Only invited people can access" defaultOpen={false}>
    The receiver of the file link cannot edit, view, or comment on the file unless they have been added directly to the file via 'Invite with email'.&#x20;
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
