Analyze and address possible performance issues in a scene to deliver the optimal device experience, every time.

## What is performance?&#x20;

Performance is optimizing a the components of a scene so that it works smoothly on the intended device. It's a crucial part of the design process because, if a scene lags or glitches when played, it will not deliver the desired user experience.&#x20;

## Scene-level performance&#x20;

It’s important to have a high-level picture of how a scene performs as it's being designer. Below are the parts of the Performance Panel that help diagnose a scene's general performance.&#x20;

### Preview Bar \[assets]

## Asset-level performance \[assets]

Assets are critical to a scene experience. However, assets are often the cause of poor performance when properties such as polycount and material size aren't monitored and optimized. The following parts of the Performance Panel can help analyze asset performance and identify potential risks.&#x20;

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Object selection & overview">
    Select an object in the hierarchy to get an overview of its properties and performance in the Performance Panel. Multiple objects can be selected at once to give a combined overview.

  <Tab title="Object view">

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Right-side viewport">
    When a selected asset is being inspected in the Geometry or Materials sections, a window will appear on the right side to display the asset. This can be used to gather insight into the asset or link to other linked root properties.

    \[asset]
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Instance selection">
    Oftentimes there's a component or material instance used multiple times in a scene. If you want to get more context on something, navigate to the right side viewport, however over it, and click the  **arrow** icon to “Select all in scene”.
