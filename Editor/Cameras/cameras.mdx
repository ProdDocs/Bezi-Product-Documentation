## Adding cameras

## Camera view

There are multiple wats to view, edit, and preview from a camera's perspective.

## Setting up cameras for a scene

Every scene requires a defined camera that the user will occupy at the start, known as "start view". Once defined, users can switch between alternative cameras options in play mode.&#x20;
