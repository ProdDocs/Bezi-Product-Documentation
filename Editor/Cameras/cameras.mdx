## Adding cameras



## Camera view

There are multiple wats to view, edit, and preview from a camera's perspective.



## Locked and unlocked cameras

Locked and unlocked cameras are key to defining a user's perspective when viewing a 3D scene. Both address specific needs based on the creators intent.&#x20;
