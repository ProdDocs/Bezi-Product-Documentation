## The importance of optimization

Most VR headsets run at 90 Hz. To have a comfortable experience in-headset, VR scenes needs to run at 90 frames per second (FPS). If a scene is too heavy and runs slower than 90 FPS, the VR experience may cause users discomfort.

## Optimizing a VR scene for headset

  <Accordion title="Turn off shadows" defaultOpen={false}>
    Shadows are known to cause performance issues in VR.

  <Accordion title="Reduce polygon count for 3D models" defaultOpen={false}>
    Models with high poly counts, often downloaded from external sources to be rendered as photorealistic images, are too big for VR scenes and real-time rendering.

    Non-destructive methods to reduce polygon count:&#x20;

    * Use models that are low-poly or created for VR&#x20;

    * Check the polygon count before downloading models from Sketchfab and Turbosquid

    * Avoid using too much subdivision, which increases poly count

    * Run models through these tools to minimize polygon count without affecting the shape:

      * MeshLab: [Polygon reduction with MeshLab](https://support.shapeways.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022742294-Polygon-reduction-with-MeshLab)

      * Blender: [How to reduce the polygons count](https://help.augment.com/en/articles/2666702-blender-2-7-how-to-reduce-the-polygons-count)

      * Unity: [Mesh Optimizer](https://styly.cc/tips/assets%CC%B2-unity-3dcg-mesh-polygon/)

    * Use primitives (ex. box, cylinder, cone, plane, etc.) wherever possible, as they're less burdensome on VR performance&#x20;

    * Bake high-poly model details into a lower-poly model to generate a normal map that  *looks* more realistic but doesnâ€™t add to the geometry itself

    * **Retopologize your heavy meshes** to bring down the polycount.

  <Accordion title="Reduce the number of objects" defaultOpen={false}>
    Too many objects in a scene can affect VR performance.

    Remove or combine objects wherever possible to avoid performance issues.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reduce the size and number of materials" defaultOpen={false}>
    Large texture file sizes or too many materials can affect VR performance.

    Reduce the texture size to the smallest possible without blurring the model. Textures that are 512px or smaller tend to work best. &#x20;

    Reduce the number of materials used in the file. Using a material atlas can help with this.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reduce number of lights" defaultOpen={false}>
    Too many lights in the scene can affect VR performance.

    If modeling in another program, bake lights in there and import them in with textures instead of using light objects.

    Area lights don't perform well in headset. If there are area lights in your scene, try replacing them with other light objects.
