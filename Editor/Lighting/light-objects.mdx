## Using light objects

***\[translate the tutorial into a few things people need to know to understand why/how to use]***

## Light object settings&#x20;

All light objects share these common settings.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Color" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the color tint of the emitted light
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Intensity" defaultOpen={false} />
</AccordionGroup>

## Light object properties

Some light objects have additional properties that can be used to customize them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Range" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the maximum range of the light. If distance is zero, light does not reduce. If distance is non-zero, light will reduce linearly from maximum intensity (at the light's position) to zero (at the distance from the light).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate of decay" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the amount the light dims along the distance of the light.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dimension" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the size of the area light.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Angle" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the maximum extent of the spotlight, in degrees, from its direction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Softness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the percent of the spotlight cone that is reduced due to penumbra.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Types of light objects&#x20;

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Point light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Point light is an omni-directional point of light. Itâ€™s a small sphere that emits light in all directions.

    Point light objects can be customized using range and rate of decay properties.

  <Accordion title="Area light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Area light is a light source emitting light from a surface. It's frequently used to simulate a computer screen, a window, or a ceiling light.

    Area light objects can be customized using dimension properties.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Spot light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Spot light emits light in the form of a cone-shape in a defined direction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Directional light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Directional light is a light that is emitted in a single direction from infinitely far away. It's often used to replicate the light effect from the sun.
