## Types of light objects

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Point light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Point Light is an omni-directional point of light. Itâ€™s a small sphere that emits light in all directions.

    **Range**: maximum range of the light. If distance is zero, light does not reduce. If distance is non-zero, light will reduce linearly from maximum intensity (at the light's position) to zero (at the distance from the light).

    Rate of decay: the amount the light dims along the distance of the light
