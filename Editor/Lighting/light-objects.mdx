  <Accordion title="Area Light" defaultOpen={false}>
    Area Light is a light source emitting light from a surface. It's frequently used to simulate a computer screen, a window, or a ceiling light.

## Light object properties

Some light objects have additional properties that can be used to customize them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Range" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the maximum range of the light. If distance is zero, light does not reduce. If distance is non-zero, light will reduce linearly from maximum intensity (at the light's position) to zero (at the distance from the light).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate of decay" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the amount the light dims along the distance of the light.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dimension" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the size of the area light.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Angle" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the maximum extent of the spotlight, in degrees, from its direction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Softness" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control the percent of the spotlight cone that is reduced due to penumbra.
