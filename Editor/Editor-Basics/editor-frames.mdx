THIS IS UNFINISHED

Find a way to rephrase this into an action: Frames are enhanced groups that provide nested objects with additional functionality, empowering creators to work more efficiently and expand their capabilities.

## Using Frames to control nested objects

Objects nested within a Frame can be [constrained](/ff51f96a54184659ac45536cb54cdea6?pvs=25#a61fcb13545d47ed8dfa8fe44decc77b) to any of the Frame’s faces.

Objects nested within a Frame can be [clipped](/ff51f96a54184659ac45536cb54cdea6?pvs=25#6fe17b613aa449dfad7957a553f4a711) by its parent Frame.

Objects nested within a Frame can be [aligned and distributed](/ff51f96a54184659ac45536cb54cdea6?pvs=25#f32eb849cb914731a844103b9bdbfb16) based on that Frame’s boundaries.
