## Importing animated 3D files

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supported file formats" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Editor supports importing GLB and FBX file formats. When importing a model from an external library such as Sketchfab, it's best practice to download the converted GLB format.

    Skeleton animations and non-skeleton keyframe animations are supported.

    Animations with morph targets are not well supported and may not play after page reload. Using models with skeleton animations work better in these cases.&#x20;
