## Connecting a Figma account to Editor \[missing assets]

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate the Figma token">
    Follow these [instructions to generate a Personal access token](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006061462-View-and-manage-account-settings) in Figma. We suggest naming the token something easily identifiable, such as "Bezi Editor token".&#x20;

    Once the access token is generated, copy it and proceed to Step 2.&#x20;
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set-up the Figma token in the Editor">
    Return to the Editor. Select an object in your scene or in the Hierarchy to open the Properties Panel.&#x20;



    Locate the Materials section of the Properties Panel. Select a Material in the section to open the popover.&#x20;



    In the popover, select the **Image Texture** icon next to color. This icon looks like a square with a diagonal line through it.&#x20;



    Click the 'Image' dropdown at the top and select **Figma** from the list.



    Paste the access token copied from Figma into the "Figma Token" text field. Press `Enter` to save.
