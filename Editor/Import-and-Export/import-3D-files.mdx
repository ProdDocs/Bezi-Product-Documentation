## Importing 3D files

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supported file formats and weights" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Editor currently supports GLB, FBX, and OBJ file formats. All files must be in one of these three formats in order to be imported.&#x20;



    All imported files should be under 100k polys, if at all possible. Any files over this limit risk affecting the speed and performance of a scene.
