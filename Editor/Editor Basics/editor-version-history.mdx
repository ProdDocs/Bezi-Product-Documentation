## Accessing file version history

There are two ways to access a file's version history:

1. Click the **Command Center** icon in the toolbar, type ‘version’, and select 'show version history' from the dropdown

2. Click the **Command Center** icon in the toolbar, hover over **file** in the dropdown, and select **show version history**

## Restoring a version&#x20;

Click the **restore** button that appears when hovering over a version in the history to restore it. Once a version is restored, it will replace the current version and can be edited as normal.

## Manually saving a version&#x20;

You can manually save a version to capture a snapshot of the file at a specific time or record a specific set of changes. These are the steps to manually save a version:

1. Click the **Command Center** icon in the toolbar, type ‘version’, and select 'save to version history' from the dropdown

2. In the dialog, name the version and press **save**.
