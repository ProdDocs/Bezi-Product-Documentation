## Asset prompt best practices

To find or create an asset that best fits your needs, we recommend using descriptive language in your prompt. Some examples of that may look like:&#x20;

* "*A wooden chest full of gold coins game asset*"

* "*Modern sleep arm chair with bright orange fabric and light wooden frame*"

* "*Photorealistic human heart 8K*"

* "*Cute blue sea turtle cartoon style*"

* "*Very detailed gold crown with gems*"
