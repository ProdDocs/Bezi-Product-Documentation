## Using Generate

Each prompt generates **4 variations of an asset.** These are low-res "preview" variations. Once you find a variation you like, you can:&#x20;

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Drop it into the scene" defaultOpen={false}>
    If you are fine with using a lower-res asset in your scene, simply select the chosen variation, drag it, and drop it in the desired place. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upscale it" defaultOpen={false}>
    To get a higher-resolution asset, select a variation and press Upscale model in the 'Model tools' bar. The process of upscaling can take up to 10 minutes and costs one credit. Credits can be purchased within the Generate panel. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generate more variations" defaultOpen={false}>
    To iterate on a variation, select the variation and press **Create variations** in the 'Model tools' bar. This operation will generate 4 new variations and costs one credit. Credits can be purchased within the Generate panel.&#x20;

## Asset prompt best practices

To find or create an asset that best fits your needs, we recommend using descriptive language in your prompt. Some examples of that may look like:&#x20;

* "*A wooden chest full of gold coins game asset*"

* "*Modern sleep arm chair with bright orange fabric and light wooden frame*"

* "*Photorealistic human heart 8K*"

* "*Cute blue sea turtle cartoon style*"

* "*Very detailed gold crown with gems*"
