## Using Generate

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Starting from Command Center" defaultOpen={false}>
    Type an asset prompt in the **Command Center** to open the Generate panel. Once open, select an existing asset from the Community assets or generate a new asset.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Starting from Generate panel" defaultOpen={false}>
    Select **Generate** from the bottom bar to open the Generate panel. Once open, type into the prompt field to search existing assets, or press **Generate** to create a new asset.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Generating new assets

**Each prompt creates 4 variations.** From there, you can:

\- **Drag and drop it into the scene.** The first variations are usually low-res (’preview’ models), but they can be generated within seconds.

\- **Upscale the model.** You can refine the texture and geometry of a variation model to get a higher-resolution asset. This operation can take up to 10 minutes.

\- **Create variations.** You can select a generated ‘preview’ model and make variations from it. This operation usually takes a few seconds, and will generate 4 variations.

## Prompting best practices

You can generate models using text prompts. For best results, use **descriptive language that describe an object**. Some examples of that might look like:

\- “A wooden chest full of gold coins game asset”

\- “Modern sleep arm chair with bright orange fabric and light wooden frame”

\- “Photorealistic human heart 8K”

\- “Very detailed gold crown with gems”

\- “Cute blue sea turtle cartoon style”
