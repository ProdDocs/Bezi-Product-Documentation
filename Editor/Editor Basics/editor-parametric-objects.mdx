## Using parametric objects

Parametric objects are shapes that can be easily edited in a non-destructive way. Primitive objects (e.g. box, sphere, cylinder, cone, plane) are parametric, and can be added to a scene through the Command Center or the Objects dropdown in the toolbar.

Once added to a scene, the **parameters** can be adjusted in the right sidebar under **Shape**.
