## Components overview

Components are elements that can be reused across multiple Editor design files. Creating instances of a component keeps them linked across files, so any changes made to the original component will propagate across all it's instances.&#x20;

<Info>
  Components are still in beta. If something doesn't work as planned or could be improved, please email [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com).&#x20;
