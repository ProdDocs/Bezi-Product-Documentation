## Components overview

Components are elements that can be reused across multiple Editor design files. Creating instances of a component keeps them linked across files, so any changes made to the original component will propagate across all its instances.&#x20;

<Info>
  Components are still in beta. If something doesn't work as planned or could be improved, please email [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com).&#x20;

## Using Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a component" defaultOpen={false}>
    There are two ways to create a component to reuse across Editor design files.&#x20;

    1. Select the desired object or group, type "component", and press `spacebar` &#x20;

    2. Right click on the desired object or group, then select 'Create a component' from the dropdown
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creating an instance of a component" defaultOpen={false}>
    Once a component is created, instances can be created to use that component across the same or different files. The instances will reflect any changes made to the main component, ensuring designs are kept in-sync with minimal effort.&#x20;

    There are four ways to create an instance of an existing component. The instance will be created in the exact same position as the component - the Hierarchy will show the new instance if it's difficult to see it in the scene.&#x20;

    1. Right click on the component and select 'Duplicate' drop the dropdown

    2. Copy and paste the component&#x20;

    3. Select the component, type "instance", and press `spacebar` &#x20;

    4. Right click on the instance and select 'Create an instance' from the dropdown
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unlinking an instance" defaultOpen={false}>
    Unlinking an instance will convert it to a regular object(s) that is no longer associated with the main component. There are three ways to unlink an instance.&#x20;

    1. Select the instance, type "unlink", and press `spacebar` &#x20;

    2. Right click on the instance and select 'Unlink instance' from the dropdown

    3. Select the instance, navigate to the 'Instance' section of the Properties Panel, then select the **Unlink instance** icon next to the instance name
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Navigating to the main component from an instance" defaultOpen={false}>
    There are three ways to navigate to the main component from an instance.&#x20;

    1. Select the instance, type "go", and press `spacebar` &#x20;

    2. Right click on the instance and select 'Go to main component' from the dropdown

    3. Select the instance, navigate to the 'Instance' section of the Properties Panel, then select the **Go to main component** icon next to the instance name

    If the main component is in a different file, that file will open in a new tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restoring a deleted component (no UI for this - error??)" defaultOpen={false}>
    Deleting a main component will not delete its instances. This mean that, if a component gets deleted, it can be restored from one of its instances.&#x20;

    1. Select the instance

    2. Navigate to the 'Instance' section of the Properties Panel &#x20;

    3. Select **Restore main component \<\<\< I dont see this option. confirm still there?**

    If the main component was in a separate file that's been deleted, the main component can be restored in the current file with the instance.&#x20;
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
