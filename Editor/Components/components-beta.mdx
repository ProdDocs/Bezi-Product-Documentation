## Components overview

Components are elements that can be reused across multiple Editor design files. Creating instances of a component keeps them linked across files, so any changes made to the original component will propagate across all its instances.&#x20;

<Info>
  Components are still in beta. If something doesn't work as planned or could be improved, please email [support@bezi.com](mailto:support@bezi.com).&#x20;

## Using Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating a component" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Creating an instance of a component" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Unlinking an instance" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Navigating to the main component from an instance" defaultOpen={false}>
    There are three ways to navigate to the main component from an instance.&#x20;

    1. Select the instance, type "go", and press `spacebar` &#x20;

    2. Right click on the instance and select 'Go to main component' from the dropdown

    3. Select the instance, navigate to the 'Instance' section of the Properties Panel, then select the **Go to main component** icon next to the instance name

    If the main component is in a different file, that file will open in a new tab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restoring a deleted component (no UI for this - error??)" defaultOpen={false}>
    Deleting a main component will not delete its instances. This mean that, if a component gets deleted, it can be restored from one of its instances.&#x20;

    1. Select the instance

    2. Navigate to the 'Instance' section of the Properties Panel &#x20;

    3. Select **Restore main component \<\<\< I dont see this option. confirm still there?**

    If the main component was in a separate file that's been deleted, the main component can be restored in the current file with the instance.&#x20;
  </Accordion>
