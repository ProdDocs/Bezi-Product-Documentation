Change the properties of a single component instance to customize the instance to its new context, without detaching it entirely.

## Overriding component properties&#x20;

Changing any properties of an instance automatically creates an override. The Editor supports overrides to an instance's transform, shape, materials, behaviors, and more.&#x20;

Examples of what can be done with overrides:

* Change the transform properties of an object - including position, rotation, and scale

* Change the shape of a primitive object

* Change the material properties - including material color, image textures, and more

* Add new behaviors - including follow and look at

* Change text object properties - including text copy, font, size, weight, etc.

* Change the visibility properties - including front/both/back, and opacity

## Pushing changes to the main component&#x20;





## Reseting all changes&#x20;
