    \- Open the **Command Center**, type “rig”, and select the Body Rig object

    \- Select an **AR or VR template** when starting a new scene. Both have a Body Rig included by default
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parenting objects to the Body Rig" defaultOpen={false}>
    Objects can be parented to any element of the Body Rig. To do so, drag an object into either the head, hand, or body.

    Once the object is inside a Body Rig element, position it where it should appear on the human form.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using behaviors with the Body Rig" defaultOpen={false}>
    Behaviors that are applied to other objects can target Body Rig elements and their children, but the Body Rig cannot have a behavior on it to follow another object.

    For example, creating a panel that follows and looks at the Body Rig head allows for accurate placement and dynamic interactions.&#x20;
