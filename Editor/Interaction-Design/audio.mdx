## Using Audio objects \[missing assets & numbering]

There are two ways to can add Audio object to a scene. Once added, Audio objects are identified in a scene by the purple speaker icon.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Adding Audio objects from the Objects menu" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Open the **Objects** menu in the top toolbar

    2. Select **Audio** from the dropdown

    3. Once selected, click in the scene to place the Audio object

       An Audio track will automatically be assigned to all Audio objects added from the Objects menu. See the documentation on how to change an Audio track below.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Importing Audio files" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Drag and drop Audio files into the Editor scene

    2. The Audio track will automatically upload and be assigned to an Audio object

    > Audio objects dropped into a scene are **not** spatial by default. To make them spatial, go to the Audio section in the Properties Panel and check the 'Spatial' checkbox.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changing an Audio track" defaultOpen={false}>
    1. Select the Audio object in the Hierarchy or in the scene

    2. Go to the Audio section in the Properties Panel

    3. Click on the name of the Audio track you want to change

    4. To upload a custom Audio file, select the **+** icon in the dropdown

    5. To use an Audio track from the Bezi Library, click the 'This File' dropdown and select 'Bezi Library'&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Supported Audio formats" defaultOpen={false}>
    The Editor currently supports MP3 and WAV formats.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maximum Audio file size" defaultOpen={false}>
    The maximum supported size of an Audio file is 5MB.

## Spatial Audio

Spatial Audio is often used to make prototypes feel more immersive. Dictate what spot in a scene the Audio object is heard from, how much space the Audio takes up, and how the track decays as it gets further away.&#x20;

## Audio object properties \[missing assets & clarification]

All Audio object properties are managed in the Audio section of the Properties Panel.&#x20;

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Playback mode" defaultOpen={false}>
    The playback mode dictates how a sound should behave on a given state. All Audio tracks are set to **Stopped** by default, so it's important to review playback modes for each track before testing a prototype.&#x20;

    **Playing**: the Audio track will automatically play on the specified state.

    **Paused**: the Audio track will not play, but will resume at a later time.

    **Stopped**: the Audio track will not automatically play.

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Playback type" defaultOpen={false}>
    Playback types control how many times an Audio track plays in a prototype. &#x20;

    **Play Once** means the Audio track will play all the way through one time. After that it will stop and reset.&#x20;

    **Loop** means the Audio track will loop until explicitly told to stop using a playback mode.&#x20;

    \[asset]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Volume" defaultOpen={false}>
    This sets the volume of a 

    **specific**

     Audio object. Adjusting volume does not affect the volume of the entire scene.  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sound range (Spatial Audio only)" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Decay (Spatial Audio only)" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Decay mode (Spatial Audio only)" defaultOpen={false} />
</AccordionGroup>
