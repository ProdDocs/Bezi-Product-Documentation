## Using Input objects \[missing assets]

Input objects define the input device and keys/buttons attached to an action. These actions are used in the State Machine \[prod doc link] to trigger an event.

    Five devices are currently supported as Input objects:

    1. Nintendo Switch

    2. Xbox

    3. PlayStation 5

    4. Keyboard and mouse

    5. Quest-based controllers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adding Input objects to a scene" defaultOpen={false}>
    Input objects can be added to a scene in two ways:

    1. Open the **Command Center**, type “input”, and select **Inputs** from the dropdown

## Using Inputs in the State Machine

<Info>
  Familiarize yourself with how to use the State Machine \[docs page link] before incorporating Inputs.&#x20;
</Info>

In the State Machine, use 'Input start' and 'Input end' to signify when an action in triggered.

1. Select **State Machine** in the bottom bar to open the State Machine panel&#x20;

2. Click a State transition to open the Events popover

3. Click the dropdown and select 'Input start' or 'Input end'

   * 'Input start' signifies when a button is pressed down&#x20;

   * 'Input end' signifies when a button is released

4. If there are multiple Inputs in a scene, select the desired one from the 'Inputs' dropdown

5. Select the desired action in the 'Action' dropdown
