**\[there's no mention of Input Methods here. should we remove that from the header to avoid confusion?]**

## Using events

Events are actions that trigger animations. Add interactions to objects using the State Machine \[prod doc link] and define events that trigger animations using the Timeline \[prod doc link].&#x20;

## Event types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto" defaultOpen={false}>
    Events automatically start playing when the scene is loaded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On pointer down" defaultOpen={false}>
    Events trigger the animation when the pointer is pressed.&#x20;

    How the 'On pointer down' event works with different input methods:

    * Mouse: Left click

    * Touch: Tap

    * VR controllers: Index finger triggers (Quest)

    * Hands: Index finger and thumb pinch
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On pointer up" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="On hover inside" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="On hover outside" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="On key down" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="On key up" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Direct touch" defaultOpen={false} />
</AccordionGroup>
