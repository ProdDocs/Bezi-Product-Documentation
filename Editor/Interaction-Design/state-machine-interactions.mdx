    \[asset]
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the desired object">
    Select the object that will be made stateful. Do this by clicking on the object in the Hierarchy or directly in the scene.&#x20;

    Observe that every object always contains two state nodes:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Base State">
        The starting point when events should occur in a specific order.&#x20;

        For example, if a sphere should grow every time you click on it.&#x20;
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Any State">
        When an interaction should always produce the same result, independent of any interactions that came before.&#x20;

        For example, if the same sphere should disappear every time `X` is pressed, regardless of its size.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

## Adding transitions between States

Activate and drag arrows between States to create transitions between them.

1. Hover over the State the object should start at / transition from

2. Wait until a dot appears near the State

3. Select the dot and drag towards the State the object will transition to

4. Release when hovering over the State the object will transition to

5. Use the popover to define which event and object will trigger the transition. For example, if the transition should happen when you click on an object (ex. Box), select the event **On pointer down** and the trigger object **Box**.
