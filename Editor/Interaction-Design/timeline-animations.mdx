  </Step>

  <Step title="Understanding the Timeline">
    The Timeline shows what State transitions are triggered by a selected object.&#x20;

    In the example below, the apple moves from ‘Base State’ to ‘Orange’ when ‘Box’ (on pointer down) is selected. ‘Box’ is the trigger object and ‘On pointer down’ is the filtered event. This means the Timeline will show all animations tied to that trigger.&#x20;
