### Usage-based overage credits

If you hit a paid plan's credit limit before the renewal, you can purchase extra credits to continue working in Bezi.

1. Open [accout dashboard](https://app.bezi.com/account) \> **Usage** tab
2. Toggle on **Enable usage-based pricing**
3. Set your monthly spending limit
4. Click `Save`
5. Log out of Bezi completely and back-in before continuing your work

### How credit usage is measured

1 credit = 1 **sucessful** prompt. A successful prompt means you submit a prompt and receive a response from Bezi. If you edit a past prompt and regenerate a response, this also counts as a successful prompt.

If you submit a prompt and Bezi gets stuck in “thinking mode” or you get an error, these won't count towards usage.
