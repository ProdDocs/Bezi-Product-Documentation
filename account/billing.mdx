To continue using Bezi after your trial, open[**Subscription Settings**](https://app.bezi.com/account)and select a plan. This will open your secure Stripe billing portal (webpage) where you will:

1. Select whether you want to be billed monthly or yearly (20% discount)

Your billing cycle will start the day you subscribe. The payment method added will be saved by Stripe and automatically charged on future renewal dates, unless changed by you.
