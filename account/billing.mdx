### How do I access billing settings?

From Bezi, navigate to Account Settings \> Subscription & Usage and clicking "Manage subscription". This opens a secure page for all billing and subscription tasks.

You can also access directly at: [**https://app.bezi.com/account**](https://app.bezi.com/account)

### How do billing cycles work?

Your billing cycle starts on the day you subscribe and renewals happen on that date, at the exact time, every month. At renewal the payment method on file is automatically charged by Stripe and, if payment goes through, your credit limit is refreshed.

### How do I start a subscription?

Open your [accout dashboard](https://app.bezi.com/account) and select the plan. This will open a secure Stripe billing portal where you:

1. Select between monthly or yearly (20% discount) billing
2. Add payment method
4. Click `Subscribe`

### How do seats work for Teams accounts?

Teams accounts come with 3 seats included and each additional seat is an extra charge. All extra seats' credits contribute to the Team credit pool. Team admins manage seats through the account dashboard.

### How do I update my active subscription?

You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel paid Bezi subscriptions. These changes happen in the [accout dashboard](https://app.bezi.com/account).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upgrade subscription">
    Upgrades **go into effect immediately**. Your existing subscription will be cancelled, along with any unused prompts, and the new subscription will start. This will reset your billing cycle to start on the day you upgrade.

    If you’re on a monthly subscription, we recommend using all your credits prior to upgrading. We cannot issue refunds for unused monthly credits.
