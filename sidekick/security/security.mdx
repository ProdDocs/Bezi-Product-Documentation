---

We know that game code is your most valued IP. We take your security and trust in Bezi very seriously.&#x20;

For any security-related questions, please email us at [security@bezi.com](mailto:security@bezi.com).

*While many independent studios and developers already trust Bezi with their game IP, we are committed to always improving our security. Please check back for regular updates.*

## **How does Bezi Sidekick define "project data"?**

Project data is scripts and assets in a Unity project that has been connected to Bezi Sidekick.&#x20;

## **What project data does Bezi Sidekick ingest?**

Bezi Sidekick syncs the scripts and assets in the connected Unity project.

We only sync the project data required to provide contextually-relevant responses - i.e. generate code or actions that make sense and work with the existing project.

## **Is my project data used to train any of the LLM providerâ€™s models?**

Never. When an AI request is made, LLM providers will see project data needed to help generate a response or output to your prompt, but our licenses with these providers ensure that your data will not be used to train their models.

## **Does Bezi have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the LLM providers?**

Not at this time. Model providers currently reserve BAAs for platforms that manage data covered by HIPAA (i.e. health-related data). However, we have and will continue to invest in all provider licenses and agreements available to us that provide optimal protection for your project data.

## **How is project data stored by Bezi Sidekick, for how long?**

For optimal application performance, scripts and select assets are cached securely on our AWS infrastructure, which is covered by our SOC2 Type2 certification, for up to 7 days.

## **How is my project data handled and secured during transit and in cache?**

We use secure protocols for project data transfer. All project data is encrypted in flight and at rest on our AWS storage infrastructure.

## **What personal data does Bezi Sidekick collect and how is it stored?**

See our [Privacy Policy](https://www.bezi.com/privacy-policy) for complete information on what personal data is collected and how it is protected by Bezi.

## **Who owns the project data created by Bezi Sidekick?**

You own all scripts and actions generated by Bezi Sidekick.
