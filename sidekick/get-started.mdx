Sidekick is an independent application that connects to your Unity project. This enables us to use the existing project context to deliver and implement AI-based recommendations and scripts that are custom to your project and keep all the work within Unity.&#x20;

**Sidekick is still in beta**. There's **error handling documentation** for self-service support. If you encounter anything confusing, report it on the [Sidekick Discord channel](https://discord.gg/cTraeg3n).&#x20;

We will reply as fast as possible to understand and fix it. This may require asking you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.

## Connect Sidekick to Unity&#x20;

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your Unity version">
    The following Unity versions can support Sidekick:

    1. Best:

       **Unity 2022 LTS**

        (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)

    2. Supported:

       **2021 LTS**

    3. Supported with risk:

       **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1**

        (in active development by Unity and doesn't reliably support external apps)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open a Unity project">
    Only open one project you want to connect to Sidekick. Make sure Sidekick is also open on your screen.

    <Tip>
      Both the Unity project and Sidekick app must be open to use them together. We recommend a split screen to see both simultaneously.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Sidekick identified the Unity project">
    Check the **Unity Project Selector** in the Sidekick menu bar to confirm Sidekick identified and connected to the correct Unity project.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Sidekick to your Unity project">
    Select the green `Install Unity Plugin` button in the Sidekick menu bar, then click on the Unity project. It will ask you for consent to install, then the Unity Package Manager popup will appear. &#x20;

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm connection status">
    When Unity and Sidekick are connected, there will be a green bar in Unity's menu and a green dot in Sidekick's menu. If the bar in Unity is red at first, **click the bar** to retry the connection.

    <Warning>
      **If either connection indicator is red, the connection must be reinstated for Sidekick to work.**&#x20;
    </Warning>
