Sidekick is an independent application that connects to your Unity project. This enables us to use the existing project context to deliver and implement AI-based recommendations and scripts that are custom to your project and keep all the work within Unity.&#x20;

**Sidekick is still in beta**. We've provided documentation to address potential errors or questions. If you encounter anything that cannot be resolved with the documentation, report it on the [Sidekick Discord channel](https://discord.gg/cTraeg3n).&#x20;

We will reply as fast as possible to understand and fix it. This may require asking you more questions to diagnose and resolve the root cause, not just the symptom.
