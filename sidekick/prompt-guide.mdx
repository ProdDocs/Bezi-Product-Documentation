### Explain the game&#x20;

Start every project by giving Sidekick context on what you’re trying to create. This also lets Sidekick help steer you in the right direction if things get off course!&#x20;

### Specifics make a huge difference!&#x20;

The clearer your prompt, the better the result. Including details like what buttons you want an action mapped to, scripts you want to update, and components you want to use make for results that are WAY more likely to fit what you’re looking for.

### Pin important or relevant information before you prompt

Pinning allows you to get specific without writing a messy, asset-packed prompt. Select the objects you want in Unity and click the pin next to them in the Sidekick prompt bar to make sure they’re factored into the answer

### Include negatives

It's just as helpful for Sidekick to know what you *don’t* want to prevent noisy behavior and hallucinations. Sidekick may *think* it understands what your prompt means, but has misinterpreted it and is heading in the wrong direction. Negatives are also helpful for behavioral debugging!

```
“I want my character to move when I use WASD. I DO NOT want them to move when I use the arrow keys, so please use key presses and NOT horizontal/vertical axes for movement”
```

### Provide references

Sidekick is well-versed in popular mechanics and games. Directly pointing to works that you take Sidekick to take inspiration from is a great way to communicate specifics while keeping the prompt brief.

```
“I want a game with a ball that rolls around a maze” vs. “I want a tilt-and-roll game like in Kirby and the Forgotten Land
```
