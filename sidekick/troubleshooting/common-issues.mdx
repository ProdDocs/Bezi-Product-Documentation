## How do I reinstate a lost connection between Unity and Sidekick?

You'll be able to identify a lost connection by checking the connection indicators in Unity and Sidekick. If either are red, the apps cannot communicate.&#x20;

There are a few common reasons and fixes:&#x20;

1. Check that you have reliable internet connection

2. Confirm both the Unity project and the Sidekick app are open

3. If the connection indicator bar in Unity is red, click on it to retry the connection

4. Check which version of Unity you're on. Sidekick supports the following:

   * Best: 

     **Unity 2022 LTS**

      (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)

   * Supported: 

     **2021 LTS**

   * Supported with risk: 

     **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1**

      (in active development by Unity, which can impact external apps)

## What do Asset Sync errors mean? How do I resolve them?

1. Do not sync while play mode is open in Unity

2. Open the Asset Sync dialog (screenshot) in Sidekick and select the 

   **Resync**

    button

3. Make sure only 1 Unity project is open at a time. Sidekick doesn’t support multiple projects open simultaneously yet. If you had multiple projects open, follow the below steps:

   1. Close the second Unity project

   2. Quit the entire Sidekick app (right click on the Sidekick app icon, select “Quit” from the dropdown)

   3. Reopen the Sidekick app and log back in
