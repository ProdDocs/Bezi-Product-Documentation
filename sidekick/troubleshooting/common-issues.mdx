### How do I know if  Unity and Sidekick aren't conntected?

You'll be able to identify a lost connection by checking the connection indicators in Unity and Sidekick. If either are red, the apps cannot communicate.&#x20;

### How do I reinstate a lost connection between Unity and Sidekick?

There are a few common reasons and fixes:&#x20;

1. Check that you have reliable internet connection

2. Confirm both the Unity project and the Sidekick app are open

3. If the connection indicator bar in Unity is red, click on it to retry the connection

4. Check which version of Unity you're on. Sidekick supports the following:

   * Best: 

     **Unity 2022 LTS**

     (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)

   * Supported: 

     **2021 LTS**

   * Supported with risk: 

     **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1**

     (in active development by Unity, which can impact external apps)

### What do Asset Sync errors mean?&#x20;

Asset Sync errors can mean a number of different things, such as: Sidekick wasn't able to access all the assets in the Unity project or the sync cut-out part way through. If you open Asset Sync there is more information on which assets failed to sync and why.&#x20;

### How do I resolve Asset Sync errors?

1. Do not sync while play mode is open in Unity

2. Open the Sidekick Asset Sync dialog and select 

   **sync**

    

   **icon**

3. Make sure only one Unity project is open at a time. Sidekick doesn’t support multiple projects open simultaneously yet. If you had multiple projects open, follow the below steps:

   1. Close the second Unity project

   2. Close the Sidekick app: right-click on the Sidekick desktop icon, select

      `Quit`

   3. Reopen Sidekick
