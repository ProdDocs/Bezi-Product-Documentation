## Unity x Sidekick connection &#x20;

If the connection indicators in Unity and/or Sidekick are red, Sidekick cannot communicate with Unity. There are a few common reasons and easy fixes for this:&#x20;

1. Check that you have reliable internet connection

2. Confirm both the Unity project and the Sidekick app are open

3. If the connection indicator bar in Unity is red, click on it to retry the connection

4. Check which version of Unity you're on. Sidekick supports the following:

   * Best: 

     **Unity 2022 LTS**

      (the latest LTS that Unity’s published)

   * Supported: 

     **2021 LTS**

   * Supported with risk: 

     **Unity 6, version 6000.0.29f1**

      (in active development by Unity, which can impact external apps)
